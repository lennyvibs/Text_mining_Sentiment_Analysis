Very light weight. Transfer rate depends upon system you're using but generally between 30-60 Mbps and in latest laptops (4-5 years old) speed is around 80 Mbps.\\n \\nGood performance\\n \\nGood product, although would like to see how long it works without issue. Hope the sellers are open to assist with warranty issues if needed.\\n \\nthis ssd is cheaper than 1tb ssd as price comparison. worth buying.\\n \\nAfter 1 month it did not starting how can i claim this product warranty\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I create YouTube videos for my wife's cooking channel and storage has been a big want for us. I have a WD MyCloud 2TB with a Seagate 4TB Backup Plus as a backup and both required power, but I need a 4TB portable hard disk and ended up in buying this Western Digital 4TB My Passport Portable hard disk (New Edition) for Rs.8198.------------------------------------------------📦 IN THE BOX & HDD CONTENTS------------------------------------------------◾ 4TB Blue Portable Harddisk in a bubble case◾ Superspeed USB cable◾ Quick Install Guide◾ WD Discovery software for WD Backup◾ WD Security and WD Drive Utilities----------------------------------------🗓️ MY USAGE & EXPERIENCE----------------------------------------The product has been manufactured in Thailand and imported to India and this New Edition WD My Passport is supposed to have lesser failures and supposed to be more robust than the previous version.Upon connecting 3.63TB was free and 297MB was used by the formatting of the disk which stores the disk geometry that allows hard disk to accept, store, and retrieve data. The hard disk was formatted with NTFS.This hard disk fits inside the palm of the hand and is quite small for a 4TB, 10.7cm length, 7.5cm breadth and 1.8cm depth, and is not heavy too.Being a portable hard disk, it doesn’t require any power. I was able to connect it with my Xbox, WD MyCloud, Laptop and Desktop with ease and it detects quite fast.The write speeds were at 110 MB/s in actual and read speeds was around 115 MB/s. The disk reports were also almost similar at 120-127 MB/s. (see attached report). But the speeds changes depending on the free disk space, how much the disk is fragmented and whether there are any bad sectors, etc. This is quite impressive in my opinion.I didn't see any heating up issues with this new edition and temperature always remained under 37 degree C even under heavy writes in my testing with room temperature around 27- degree C.The WD Discovery software is super cool, it can import files from social media and maintain a backup. Just need to sign into Facebook or Instagram or Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive. It can also take a backup from WD MyCloud devices.The WD Security app provides a way to setup a password for the hard disk and contents can be encrypted, so when data is written it's encrypted and when data is read it's decrypted when password is used. I haven't tried any brute force recovery of data on this disk yet but the encryption seems to be good enough for home use. I didn't set the password as if password is forgotten I can't recover it back and only way to re-use the disk is by formatting.The hard disk has a small led indicator which can be turned off from the WD Discovery settings if required.I was able to backup all my YouTube video edits with ease and quickly, also was able to back up my Dropbox.I don't see any cons as of now, and since I haven't contacted the customer service I can't comment on that part.-------------------------💖 WHAT I LIKED-------------------------◾ 3 years warranty◾ Good looking and light weight◾ Automatic backup, Password protection + 256bit Encryption◾ Fast read and write speeds-------------------🥇 OVERALL-------------------A great hard disk at a good pricing. This new edition should be more stable and when take care well like not moving the hard disk while it being used, doing a safe eject of the hard disk, not dropping etc. this hard disk should last longer in my perspective, only time will tell. Overall am happy with my purchase as it meets my expectations.\\n \\nVery beneficial\\n \\nThis is a very very early review. Will definitely update after 6 days, if anything happens and then will try to update subsequently. Now, coming to delivery, I am very pleased as it just arrive in one day. Packaging wise, it was good, both outside and main packaging.  After I inserted the HDD, I got around 931 gb of free space, I download the apps and set my password, but could not register the product from the app. The speed initially, as can be seen from above photo, seems really good but let's see for how long it can maintain that speed. But, it has some sound inside, not annoying but upon bringing little closer to ear, you can hear it. Don't know it's normal or not, so have to check it properly. Rest, so far so good. But it's really damn light and very small.\\n \\nPruchased it for one of my friend as I am from IT filed and he asked me to do it for him. I have used WD portable and WD desktop drives for my personal use so I recommended this for him.\\n \\nVery nice Harddisk 😊\\n \\nDidn't get any big discount for the independence day week purchase, but got it at 5.4k which is very less than what the local sellers quote. The size of this hard disk is very small and one can easily fit it into the front shirt pocket if they wanted to. It is very lightweight so you won't notice any issues while carrying it during travels.Storage is 2TB but 1.81TB is what can be used.I have used it for 2 days now and I am getting around 112 to 130MB/s speed transfer using USB 3.0.I chose the color blue, but one side is still black while the front side is black.There is one cable provided for you to connect this to your pc but it is very small and because of that you need to keep it next to your port.WD provides 3 years warranty. You will be able to get a replacement for your broken hard drive if it stopped working for 3 years total. You need to register for it on their website. I don't think physical damage is considered under this 'limited warranty'.If it breaks, you'll lose your data. The replacement under warranty does not consider any data loss you'll have.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I wish I could've gotten more discount though!\\n \\nGood product\\n \\nGood product\\n \\nValue for money\\n \\nBefore you pull out your pitchforks, I'm a big WD fan. I have been using their products for years and have yet to have a single hard drive failure. Even my oldest powered 2TB WD My Book drive from 2013 is still alive and kicking today. That being said, Seagate products have learnt from their early mistakes and their hard drive are now more or less just as reliable as WD products (google: BackBlaze hard drive stats).However since WD have enjoyed their spot at the top, they don't feel like they need to provide anything more than the bare minimum so what you get when you buy a WD 5TB My Passport is just the hard drive and a USB cable and nothing else, no extras for 8999 INR.However, with the Seagate OneTouch 5TB, for the same price, you also get a 1 year trial of Mylio (a pretty cool self-hosted alternative of Google Photos), a 4 month trial of Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan and 3 year Rescue Data Recovery Services. The last part is the one of the best perks of getting a Seagate product. What it means is that over the 3 year warranty of your product, if your Seagate HDD breaks down, you get 1 in-lab data recovery attempt by Seagate for free.Both WD and Seagate will replace your HDD if it fails but Seagate will also attempt full data recovery on the failed drive once during that 3-year warranty period which mind you, is a huge perk. Data recovery services aren't cheap and generally cost like 10-20 times the value of the HDD itself.Now coming to performance differences between the two, I'm attaching all the different tests I've conducted on both hard drive using CrystalDiskMark 8. They're pretty much identical but WD has the lead over Seagate for smaller file transfers while Seagate does slightly better at large sequential file transfers.The WD drive was already formatted using NTFS while Seagate was using exFAT out of the box. After formatting the Seagate HDD to NTFS, the sequential write performance decreased by around 5-10 MB/s. I hadn't encrypted the WD drive but the Seagate was encrypted using the Seagate Toolkit (which may or may not have contributed to some performance decrease, I don't know).\\n \\n1st one was not working! Got easy replacement! Kudos to the seller. Ultra portable, good form factor.\\n \\n2TB capacity, fast transfer speed, bought the case separatelyIt's my 2nd 2TB external HDD. Totally worth to keep backup of personal photography files and its compact and palm sized.Effective usable capacity 1.81TB.\\n \\nThere's a huge debate about which external hard disk is the best as there are many brands getting famous in India after Sony stopped exporting hard disks here! Sony is the best among all the other brands, no debate! But after Sony I think WD is the next best, since seagate, toshiba and other brands aren't good for long term, durability is most important factor according to me in hard disks ofc and I think WD is most durable among the available options!\\n \\nGot 2TB (actually 1.8 TB) at a discount for less than 5K. Working okay for last 3 months. Waiting to see how long this works without issue.\\n \\nThose who are seeking a perfect portable storage option go for it.\\n \\nNice to carry and have enough space\\n \\nGood 👍🏻\\n \\nSpeed little bit slow.Sometimes it goes very fast but some time its going too slow.So its not give constant speed.So my suggestins is don't buy External Harddrive, go for External SSD so you can get more speed at constant rate.\\n \\nnice product, value for money\\n \\nSorry by mistake I have given wrong review for this item is okay as per my requirement\\n \\nLight weight..responsive..nice authentic\\n \\nVery compact and nice product, paching was also good, but Little low on transfer speed then expected. And also the cable is loose or the port on hard disk is damaged it gets disconnected on little movements.\\n \\nWorking great after using for a few months.I use crystaldiskinfo to monitor drive health and no issues so far.\\n \\nGood worthy\\n \\n*HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED *1. Facing so many issues in this.2. Now and then entire hard disk shows like like empty hard disk.3. Connecting take ages. It's not Full loaded got 4tb left still me facing this issue.4. Even while working on Files in Premier pro, Phoptoshop suddenly it will say file not accessible\\n \\nvery good\\n \\nWhile sleek and compact, it also looks rugged.

WD tools make setting up the password and backup effortless. Good speed too. It's really worth it.\\n \\nWD external disk is very good for storage and easy to carry. But speed of data transfer is a bit slow compared to seagate.\\n \\nStorage\\n \\nworks perfectly.. and durable\\n \\nGood looking &Light weight\\n \\nNice prodect\\n \\nI love it\\n \\nThe best product and compatibility, it's just installed and very easy to use\\n \\n100mbps\\n \\nIt's affordable and does the job well.\\n \\nPerformance is okay-okay:------------Sequential write of ~5GB iso file was ~110 to 120MB/sSequential write of 4K quality photos (~2GB) was poor ~30 to 50MB/sWas expecting a lot better. Using Windows 10 Pro.Issues faced so far:-------------------------[1] Windows Explorer miscellaneously failed: Upon first power-on and trial of writing nearly 10GB data, explorer quickly shows (within 3seconds) all writes done, but nothing was written to disk. No idea what was wrong. This happened 3-4 times when retried. Finally did 1-folder at a time and it worked.[2] This is very bad and need every time care:After safely removing drive from Windows System Tray, windows shows all good to disconnect, but the HDD still has LED continuously flickering for 3-7 seconds or perhaps more. I had to wait for the LED to completly unglow for 5+ seconds before disconnecting from USB port. The LED is not bright, thus it will be difficult to notice this everytime unplug being performed.[3] Warranty registration:Only received email showing product serial number got registered successfully. The dates of purchase are all BLANK in the email received.  The serial number on Invoice from Appario seller is different from what's on the HDD.\\n \\nGot in prime day offer for 8k - 5TB with no cost emi.

Honestly,it is terrible! When I first bought the drive an year ago, it used to give me max 90 mb/s r/w speeds on my older laptop with usb 3.0 port(very rarely reaching 100 mb/s at times). The thing is that happened only in the initial few months of using the drive. After that the max speeds never really reached that high(only very rarely or occasionally). It now stays in the range of 30-70 mb/s(very variable speeds at times). Compare that to toshiba and seagate, with toshiba I get around 80-153 mb/s read/write speeds with it usually staying in the high speed category(110mb/s+, 130mb/s average with it hitting 147 mb/s very frequently),even after filling most of the drive and using it for quite long(talking in refernce to Toshiba canvio gaming, i have heard similar praises and also tried other canvio drives too and they perform the best among the competition). With seagate, I get consistent r/w speeds usually around 133 mb/s(key point being consistent). I haven't tested seagate fully(also it being newer) but from initial impressions I can say that it's miles beyond wd one(I have seagate expansion drive new). Also point to be noted is that western digital drive performance decreases with more data being stored on it. One reason for such major performance impact maybe it's hardware encryption, as quite some users have pointed out on the internet that hard drive encryption can slow down speeds(with wd drive having hardware encryption by default).Secondly,the drive heats up a lot even when it's idle. After an year of using it, when copying files from wd to other drive it many a times sits at around 80% active time(meaning the drive is not working to it's full capacity). Idle temps on the drive hover above the 42C mark(noticed it after an year of using it) which is quite hot to touch. While in operation it easily crosses 50C(I could only cool it by keeping it above a cooling pad). One thing however is that seagate drives also get hot but they do so slowly and quickly dial back in temp when they are not on load, which doesn't happen with wd(temp stays high for a very long time). Thermal Insulation on wd drive is also very bad, you can feel the heat directly by touching the drive(no insulation) and the bottom part being the hottest. With seagate(expansion drive) you can feel the heat only on a small part on the bottom in the new design. With toshiba gaming drive the top part is completely heat isolated and only the bottom part gets hot(which can sometimes be misleading but toshiba does the job well). The toshiba drives also remain a lot cooler than both seagate and wd drives and also dissipate heat a lot faster.Thirdly,wd my passport drives are very prone to fragmentation and it is ridiculously hard to defragment at times. I could only get defraggler to get to defrag the drive with all other defrag programs refusing to even touch the drive. Defrag times shows well over 3h for a 100gb defrag(other drives do this in minutes).Update:I also checked my laptop internal wd blue drive and it also performs horribly like the external one however it's performance is more consistent. In general wd drives are not very good performance wise(esp external).Based on the above points my recommendation would be to buy other company's drives. Only buy this one if you are not concerned about heat,poor performance etc.\\n \\nI have ordered WD passport 1tb hardrive, when It got delivered, i have opened it with lot of excitement but I could see the product's box itself too old and it's teared off, and obviously it's used by someone and returned or something else. After seeing that I didn't even get a feel of opening the box, i felt like paying money for new and getting second hand product and I have starightaway messaged the costomer care. They have agreed for the refund (product only eligible for replacement) and they felt sorry for the issue aswell. And I have ordered another one freshly and it got delivered today and it looks so cool and new and gives good feel. And I used it aswell, it's so light and fast, yet to discover more.\\n \\nI Received a Product YesterdayVery SmallLight WeightEasy To Carry2TB WD My PassportTransfer Speed 115 MB/s ( 207GB File 30min) Also Real Time 👍Over Heating Transferring Bulk Files 👎Over Heating Started Within 5 Minutes 👎But Performance is Good 👍OVERALL GOOD ONEOnly Heating IssueOne think to courier partnerPlease use bubbles cover on product for safety purposeI received ah product package in pressed condition\\n \\nVer very good\\n \\nGood product\\n \\nThe product was just okay lot of the time it won't show in laptop and the password protection was garbage. In built software for password protection is useless it didn't even recognise device lot of the time. Files transfer speed was also very low for this price rage. Wd disappoints me a lot.\\n \\nSpeed and design is good.\\n \\nBest company good product. I used since 2010.\\n \\nOkay, first things first. If you are buying this particular model of HDD, be sure to get an Alexvyan shockproof case with it. If you accidentally drop it, you will lose all of your precious data. Also, despite what another person says in their review, do NOT enable write cacheing, unless you want to end up with an expensive brick, when you inadvertently remove this HDD from your PC without using 'Safely remove hardware'.Now, on to the product itself. I first bought this HDD in August 2020. I don't know if Amazon sent me a faulty product or if I was careless, but the HDD went kaput in the first month of usage. RMA'ing it was a breeze, but I lost all of my precious data, and data recovery prices are through the roof. As far as storage goes, you won't get better than WD. The read and write speeds aren't half-bad either. But you will need to handle your HDD with the utmost caution to avoid any sort of damage or data loss. Use only for storage and backup. If using as a storage device for your Plex library, make sure you always keep it on a flat surface, and be sure to periodically disconnect it from your computer to avoid physical damage or reallocated sectors.As far as form factor and looks, an all-black serrated design looks very pristine, though I'd prefer to go for the red colour next time when going for my next WD HDD. The HDD isn't lightweight, and to make things worse is extremely slippery, very heavy and has a bad centre of gravity. Hence my words about careful handling apply even further.Tl;dr great HDD for the storage, average to good read/write speeds, but if you prefer something more rugged, go for Seagate and do a full format from the default exFAT to NTFS.EDIT: I'd also like to point out that the data security feature is mega useless. It encrypts the whole hard drive with a password, rather than certain folders, and this sometimes results in computers being unable to read the drive. Better to use BitLocker, or maybe don't give your HDD to ANYONE, much less people who would snoop around, looking at your 'private' files.\\n \\nI received product as same as they said in product specs..Transfer Rate also very good..I checked the transfer speed as local and network also.Both are satisfied.Connectivity also good.\\n \\n1.8 TB storage getLight weight and slim\\n \\nGreat product, registered online.

More than just the storage space and transfer speeds, it's the Supremely Sleek design and WD software support that makes this product unique.I personally loved the Red variant of all. The Red - Black Dual color combination with matt finish just makes the whole hardrive design very minimalistic. If you are person who want to carry light and smart, this product perfectly suits it. Though it's named Passport, it's much smaller than a passport. Fits easily in the palm and does slip out easily.-----------------------⏩⏩ Box Contents:-----------------------1 Western Digital Passport, 1 Data Cable and 1 User Manual .------------------⏩⏩ Features:------------------🔷 Usable Storage Space : 1.81 TB🔷 USB 3.0 Speeds.

Go grab it.\\n \\nWhit less smart Hdd\\n \\nUsing from few months, working very good till now..Reading /writing very smooth ..\\n \\nNice...\\n \\nProduct is good it's looking nice .\\n \\nIts comapct handy and fairly quick, real easy to use.\\n \\nThe product has some minor scratches on the body a small little that is only the drawback I experienced\\n \\nVery light and a large storage.\\n \\nI used for 1year for a very little duration .... recently I started using a little bit more for my sister's marriage pics and videos 400gb I stored and when I thought of copying it into laptop the hard disc was not detecting by  any system.....I took it to the computer service centre they diagonise and said the media driver was gone for a toss......now all my data was gone within few days....now am not sure even the data recovery centre can retrieve the data.....so be careful guys\\n \\nWD quality is good and performance is as per expectations so far .( 3months of usage)\\n \\nWhen received, I tested for some 90GB transfer of files, seems to be functioning excellent. Will try another transfer of files and let you know later, if any malfunctions or any other. Otherwise it will be good.\\n \\nReceived as expected\\n \\nsmaller than iphone 12 but with 5TB capacity, no external power source. A wonderful piece of tech with only 8k price. Using it 6months now. Read write speed more than 100 mbps. Very well recommended.\\n \\nIt's been a wonderful device since the time I've first purchased it couple of years ago.  The storage you get is around 3.63 TB and due to my heavy usage it's already coming to it's full capacity lol.  Overall, i don't have much complaints not have faced any issues till now.\\n \\nNice product\\n \\nThe build quality is good especially the new and compact design like before the wd hard drive used to be a heavy and thick one but this one is really slim easy to carry light Weight.Copy speed is up to :- 110-120mbps which is good 👍\\n \\nI have only used up to half the full drive capacity and the read write performance still feels good as new without any signs of slowing. I deliberately chose a larger drive than my intended usage capacity as these drives tend to slow down as they get full.\\n \\nIt's still working superb...And data transfer speed is good....Light weight....Totally fine product....\\n \\nGreat\\n \\nAfter all its a hard disk, nothing so special. Yeah it does the work perfectly, no worries.\\n \\nVery fast and handy gorgeous light weight\\n \\nLight weight, colour, storage  capacity nice\\n \\nWD Is good brand hard-disk . . .\\n \\n- 1.81 TB of usable storage for 2TB hard drive.- I could see copying speeds up to 118MB/s.- The hard drive is really compact and lightweight. I wasn't expecting it to be this compact.- Loved the build quality and the textured finish of the product.- Absolutely no issue at connecting to various devices.- The chord is relatively short. But does the job pretty well.Rest all is pretty standard, and as described in the about section of the product.An easy recommendation for anyone who is looking to buy a hard drive.\\n \\nIt is about my experience.Light Weight, easy portability, and i space is as mentioned.Pros:I am unable to register\\n \\nBest for this price\\n \\nVery good product\\n \\nThe software on the HDD won't install or has problems. One has to visit the website. It's a bit confusing. For Backup had to install from their website.\\n \\nI have been buyers of Western digital products for a long time. The seals/packing of WD external hard drives should be made more strong and reliable. Even some packets I have received in semi-open. Packing of products can be easily opened. See picture.\\n \\nQuality and storage and spped are good\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The product stopped working today idk what's happened can u replace it ?\\n \\nThe moment I tried to connect the HDD, the device started huge noise as if there the internal FAN of a cooler was switched ON. I didn't expect the noise/sound from a HDD. I had a WD HDD which was working fine and without noise. I was surprised that the new one had this issue. The second issue was accessing the HDD. Initial few times I got a popup asking to format the drive and when I tried to format I got an error message that the format failed due to an error. I started to doubt if this was really a new piece or a refurbished piece. Sellers do have a habit of cheating the customers by getting rid of defective pieces first. I believe that happened today as well. Overall, the HDD is working fine now though it gave me some initial trouble. There is an occasional noise from the HDD and I don't know the reason for that. I'm not that happy because of this experience of buying electronic product online. This definitely makes me remember before I decide to order an electronic product again.\\n \\nআমি বিগত দুই বছরে নিজস্ব ব্যবহারের জন্য WD HARDDISK  চারটে কিনেছি । খুব ভালো সার্ভিস । সব থকে বড় ব্যাপার হল আজ অবধি কোন ডেটা মিসিং হয়নি কিম্বা ক্রাক হয়নি । ধন্যবাদ ।\\n \\nVery good product.\\n \\nEasy to handle light weight  External Hard disk  and Data transfer speed also very good  .\\n \\nCoping speed is ok\\n \\nI am using this product for daily cleaning of sofas, wall dusting\\n \\nThis is my 1st time purchasing an external HDD, I chose WD reading all those reviews and hearing their prompt services, anyway so I transferred almost 40gb stuffs from my laptop to this hdd and the transfer speed was around 70mbps on average and took me nearly 6 minutes, I was expecting it to touch over 100mbps mark as it has USB 3 but anyway... The product is extremely light weight and small, great for portability\\n \\nNa\\n \\nEdit 13rd week of 2021The looks are just fine. Usually these devices come as plug and play, but this time I couldn't figure out what the issue is. My PC recognizes this device as does my previous WD HDD. But i couldn't use the new one. As seen in the image, it shows as unallocated space in the disk partition, and i cant make it to work. This is highly unusual and let's see what amazon will do for this.Edit 24th week of 2021Amazon amazes me as usual.. Got a brand new one for my faulty drive, within the replacement window without much hassle.And abt the new drive, it sure is a cool one. Yet to check the speeds and other info. With 4.54 tb space from my 5tb drive, i will update as soon as it passes the test for bad sectors.. And i would recommend doing that mandatorily for new drives.Pros1 good looking, taking very small space and light in weight2 good built quality3 doesn't make much noise.Cons1 very small led notification light.2 slight heating up during checking phase.On the whole, just like the Marvel and DC fued, don't get confused over Segate and this, because years of my experience has made it clear that WD Is reliable and stays with you for years to come, given you handle it properly..Just check for the bad sectors when u get it new and just plug and play..Will update after further usage..\\n \\nWith USB 2.0 it gives a transfer rate of about 22 Mbps. Although it keeps on varying from 1 Mbps to 22 Mbps. With USB 3.0 port it gives a transfer rate of about 40 to 50 Mbps. At one point of time iI also got a transfer rate of about 70 Mbps. My laptop has USB 2.0 port so it gave about 20 Mbps. At first I thought of returning it but when I used it in USB 3.0 port, it gave 40 Mbps transfer rate. After searching on net, I found that every harddisk gives this much transfer rate although they mention speeds in Gbps but that's all theoretical. So if you want to buy a harddisk you can go for this as it's durabilty and serviceability is high as compared to other brands. Also it is very small in size and hence portable.Also, you will get a storage of 931 GB although it has a storage of 1 TB.\\n \\nThis is great for backups and exchange data with friends and family members but only thing is I cannot connect it with my Samsung Galaxy phone they should provide an additional software for connecting it to Android devices\\n \\nSuper\\n \\nGetting Very slow transfer speed\\n \\n1)Transfer speed is 110 to 120 Mb, don't expect hight rate transfer speed above one is maximum  speed I noticed while transfering data from laptop to hard disk.2) Design is too good.3) really slim and fit into pocket also.4) compatiability is nice.5) packaging is tight and crisp.6) Deliver time packaging was good from Amazon.7) data security also given in the hard disk.8) I purchased in ₹4444 2TB HARD DISK.You can got for it if you want a pocket friendly and fit in to your budget.\\n \\nValue for money\\n \\nGood प्राइस sleem product\\n \\nVery handy and light weight. Been a month. Nothing more to say.\\n \\nData storage\\n \\nPlease don't buy this it stopped working and the seller does not respond even in warranty period.Update Amazon helped me get in touch and I got a new  replacement hard disk which works fine.\\n \\nIt was delivered within 24 hours. The size of the HD and the speeds of data transfer are awesome. I was initially looking for 1-2 TB but the price of the HD attracted me to go for 5TB.The actual capacity is 4.5 TB.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The purpose of WD 4TB  my passport is to be a backup drive of your data. It is well designed for the purpose. I have had many WD products in the past and they have been very reliable. I want to share some great features about this product1. Storage capacity I have bought WD 4TB My Passport Portable External Hard Drive, Blue - with Automatic Backup, 256Bit AES Hardware Encryption & Software Protection2. Transfer SpeedThe WD My Passport 4TB comes with a portable hard drive and a high speed USB 3.0 connector. The portable storage comes with a 3 year warrantyI had no problem transferring both large files taking several minutes and many many smaller files in large batches back and forth between PC and drive.3. Portability and durabilityIt's small size and light weight make it great for traveling and being able to grab and go and it won't take up much desk space. I highly recommend the My Passport.There’s also an option to save backups to a cloud service such a Dropbox so you don’t have to worry about bringing the drive with you everywhere.4. SecurityThe drive comes with WD Discovery for either Windows and Mac. You can set up the hardware encryption with this app. With the encryption software, you can set a password so that whenever you access the hard drive you have to enter the password. You can protect your private data. You can set up scheduled backups through the app. You cannot schedule it through Windows if you have hard drive encryption enabled5. CompatibilityPreloaded on the drive is a pair of install wrappers for Western Digital’s Discovery dashboard – one for Windows and one for Mac. Running them should, ideally, download the latest version of the utility from the internet and install it on your machine (go to Western Digital’s support website and download it from there before it would actually work.) This then lets you install 3 basic apps: one for backups, another for security management, and one for maintenance and health monitoring of the drive.6. GamingUSB 3.0 is quite important here as the speed can affect its waiting time and game responsiveness. This drive comes with USB 3.0 that matches the speed of ssd also It matches PS4 colours.Only con is there is no USB type C.Overall, if you need an affordable portable drive as storage expansion or for backing up your computer, you will find my passport 4tb is an easy and safe choice.\\n \\nBeen using it for a couple of months now, no issues so far. I also edit photos from it, speed is good enough for that.\\n \\nGood...\\n \\nStorage capacity is good but not working properly\\n \\nJUST CHECK for the bad sectors after purchasing and i think the write speed is low\\n \\nNot responding with laptops it's damage pic and your agency tack back product and not replaced new one or not refund payment please solve problem\\n \\nAmazon asked me what I liked or disliked while writing the review.Dislike: My first order for this product (seller Appario) was a fake one. When I held the hard disk it felt lightweight, on connecting it to two laptops on different ports the light would switch on however the disk drive would never show. The hard disk didn't vibrate (rotating disks were not felt). The disk management of windows didn't detect it too. It simply showed up in task bar as 'My Passport 6267'. Upon checking USB drivers it showed 'Code 43: Set Address Failed'. Seems a pretty famous error if you look it up on Google. Checked the S/N on WD site and it showed Warranty till 2024. Strange. Tried to update drivers, but no success. Finally put it in replacement.Like: Same seller this time sent original product. Got 3.63 TB usable out of 4 TB. Write speeds are ~117 Mb/s (copying from HDD to laptop or reverse, both same). Hard disk is really portable and I liked the colour options. Bought a case for it as well (separate positive review on that too.)Thank you.\\n \\nOne of the best options available in the market. Portable, Lightweight, Cross-Device Compatible and Value for Money.Test with my Realme GT Master Edition (Android Phone) over OTG. Working fine.Transfer speed is upto 80-100Mbps on 7200rpm HDD with AMD Ryzen 7 5600H (Windows 11)\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Amazing product with good quality and looks awesome\\n \\nI am using this drive for past one year and it served me well.I have been using it to carry my data as carrying my gaming laptop to my collage is quite hard.The drive is quite reliable when it comes to speed. the speed is good.It offer some great security for the price as it offers hardware based security at this price point.If you are looking for a slim, reliable and secure HDD then you can't go wrong with this one.Its a open recommendation from me just go for it.\\n \\nThe drives look very nice, and are half as thick as my old WD drives with the same capacity. Transfer speed is about the same. But these drives are noisy! I have two of them. And I haven't had such noise drives since the 90's when I could hear my disk drive. I just use them for backups so I don't care, but its a surprise that considering older WD drives don't make so much noise, these do. I doubt I received a defective one, because I have two drives, and both are noisy. This is just the way they are.\\n \\nYes its light weighted.its too small in size u can carry in palm easly.\\n \\nNice product\\n \\nGreat deal at its price\\n \\nPortable and the right size\\n \\nNice, less noisy , good speed\\n \\nColour is white and somewhat little storage due to internal aap installation.\\n \\nVery comprehensive lightweight nice product\\n \\nIt's much better than i expected.Slim and light weight. Data transfer speed is good. Boots fast.Design is also fine.Cable is quite short.But couldnt install wd software. Tried 4 to 5 times, still it didnt.\\n \\nLiked it\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\nVery compact product from trusted brand. Quality product\\n \\nIt is handy and has good storage capacity. Copy speed is okay, will recommend this product to everyone.\\n \\nWell, it's good but you should go for one with type cIt can easily give speed of 120mbps write speedSome will find problem like writing speed is 25mbps but there is a solution for that...Some people may find problem with connectivity that it's not showing in your pc or something like that but it's not a huge problem at all you just do one thing go on YouTube and search your problem will be solved...It's compact and lightweight in this segmentI'm not talking about SSDSSDs are very light than HDDBut in HDD segment it's comparatively light\\n \\nIt is better... lightweight... portable...nice design... storage is about 1.8T....transfer speed is quite good... quality is good...Comes with password protection... backup and some more features...Overall satisfied with the product.\\n \\nWD is best to choose among other brands it's not like other brands are bad but considering every aspect of WD that includes service,product quality,longivity etc WD is best and WD failure rate is lower compare to Seagate and other brands actually quality defers from region to region guys and for those who are complaining about disk not working etc etc plz don't try to plug and unplug the cable to hdd more no of times cuz the brands are made them worst by manufacturing the inside drive as a soldered to motherboard and it's not good when u plug and unplug many times roughly then the solder will loose its grip and may break from motherboard so use it delicately and we request the ext hdd manufacturers to bring back the old sata type connection not this crappy soldered models... And the reading speed writing speed are as usual 120-140mbps in usb 3.0 & 3.1 interface ... Thank u wd and Amazons intime delivery and package is awesome.\\n \\nGood product nice\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\nRead write speed are almost same 120 mbps... Though some vedios shows 4-5 gbps transfer rate from hard disk to pc but I never got that speed  even though I have a  thunder bolt port and usb 3.2 gen 1 port.. In both speed are the same good for average speed transfer\\n \\nIt is not supporting PS4.\\n \\nGood\\n \\nWhen I recieved it I was happy i had earlie purcahe red one which spins a lots even afater safely remove this one not seems.I tested it usign hdd regenration and then Hdd tune pro again 5 time i tested for surface test usign hdd sentinel scanning took in usb 3 only 4 hours 20 mins and scannign in hdd regenratio 5 hours 20 min that insane  in usb 3 i means else it ould hav kten 2 days in usb 2.0 .And transfer speed i means i copied my old WD 4tb files to this  i put in usb 2 that old wd 4tb and tranfer somver 800 gb and the speed was averatge 37mb/sec .this hardisk was attachd in usb 3 .Normally the speed might reach 200 mb /sec if connected both in usb 3 or even more as scannign speed during surface test and otehr test shows that speed 240 mb/sec.Hpe it lasts more than5 yeas as i had one WD drive interal still over 1750 days runtime stil no errors another wd i purcahsed in sep 2014 1 TB wd passport ultra from amazon used occasional still no badsector .Wd are reliable .Just need to be carefully if so many chuk files like photos and all corrupts the MFT table as large amount of files they are i mean photos and all small files .If large fiels i had less no of file count ..the MFT get corrupted.Use paragon hardisk manager to compact mft .and it works again.Still never believe a hardisk it can' fail any time alwasys keep backup copy 3-2-1 rule .Keep mft record of that hardisk using Wiztree software (mft dump ) you can use to analyse if hardisk get corrputed or data recovery time .\\n \\nGood storage capacity\\n \\nIt has enough space for my movies and game storage. It has great speed and .the design is simple and super. I really loved the product .\\n \\nNothing\\n \\nIt's so small just fight to pocket data transfer is speed as compared to my old sony. Till now it's performance is nice. Perfect for daily use and travelling perpose\\n \\nBest external HDD with enough capacity to store. More importantly, oraganized files rather than Junk. Else, you'll keep crying for more storage even after having 4TB of storage space.\\n \\nWent for this Passport HD storage due to WD's reputation, even though my experience with an earlier WD Elements drive was not that great.Issues with Passport Drive:1. WD Discovery did not install initially. I tried on 2 separate computers running Win 10. It would install till 18% and then not proceed. This is a known issue if you search on the net. Surprising that WD hasn't fixed it yet.2. Following the workarounds managed to install WD discovery. Next the WD backup app didn't install. This too had to be worked around before was finally able to install it.3. Transferring files took ages. Got error messages for several files (documents, images etc), which didn't get copied.4. The transferred files and folders on the drive did not display when I attached the drive to my other computer. That was the main reason I got the drive, to be able to have the files in one place to use on several computers!Conclusion: Installing, running and transferring files was very time consuming and frustrating.  It's better to install other software for backup/transferring files. Much faster and more reliable.Am unlikely to go with any WD products again.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\nGood\\n \\nDrive got corrupted even though I was careful with the usage. Fortunately, I got it replaced.\\n \\nI love this Hard disk it's quite compact and easy to use. I have kept my data on this disk have not got any issues regarding data corruption or any other issues so far. It also have a feature to encrypt the disk with password which tightens the data security.\\n \\nWriting review for a replacement drive after the first one failed very shortly within a day of using it. Suddenly after a while the drive started to make loud fan-like noise with lots of clicking sounds(the drive head trying to copy/fetch data) and finally after sometime I heard the 'Click of death' (Google it if you want to know more) and the drive stopped getting recognized by Windows and the OS stopped responding whenever this drive was plugged in. I googled and got to know that it happens when there are bad sectors detected or mechanical failure inside. Luckily after sometime I was able to copy back the data from the drive to my local existing internal HDD drive and immediately asked for replacement. Thanks a lot to Amazon for getting it quickly replaced by a new drive.I used a software recommend by Western Digital to check the health of the drive - Data Lifeguard Diagnostic for Windows. Great software to check for problems with any HDD.Works fine when there are no mechanical problems inside and is light weight and portable too. Have to be a little more careful while handling it because of it's size.\\n \\nContains much more space that I could save my whole laptop data at once!!! Must have…\\n \\nI got a storage capacity of 1.8GB that’s a bit low on the product and the security software is not concluded have to download it separately again overall the product is fine slim and elegant\\n \\nWas in a dilemma whether to buy WD or Seagate - they are both equally reputable in this space. Post analysis settled for this version of the My Passport has it seemed like it was good in terms of value for money. In terms of the seller, no issues.However, WD Passport ( and i'm assuming all the other external hard disks) have some serious compatible issues with MAC. In my case, I was on a high Serrier version OS and my passport was not being detected by MAC. After alot of research across WD Website, Forums, Blogs etc - I figured out that it's a very common issue with alot of folks worldwide. In the end, I had to upgrade to the latest OS ( Big Sur), download WD Utilities and post some messing around, it magically got detected.Once, its detected there are no issues and works great !\\n \\nNo words than the bestest drive in the market. I have already used all other brandsBut It's the best ever\\n \\nOverall it was good. No problem in product. Perfectly fine but the cover in which it was sent was broken. I did not complain as product was ok.\\n \\nThe WD is best for making storage hard drives.Pros:1. I got product on time and started using it from same day. till now no issues.2.100mbps+ Read speed with USB 3.0 only.3. Write speed is little slow(max 30mbps).Cons:1. The only drawback is, it give you 4500GB space instead of 5120GB and as you know 10% of drive need to be empty to get better performance. That means 450Gb is useless and you actually get 4TB for proper usage while you paid for 5TB space.2. The WD have a contest to fool you (at least by this seller). The same HDD is on amazon without that scratch coupon , it have free HDD portable cover worth of Rs.1000.3. Also that WD software which comes inside HDD is useless, as in regular usage you don't need such software's. I agree in initial days of usage you might face some HDD detection issues, but that are just USB driver specific only.(you need to update USB drivers if needed)Conclusion: don't get fool for laptop and go with HDD which have free cover and also try to research on which HDD give you more space (i.e WD4TB,2TB,1TB or any Other brand with good storage) and go with it no matter which brand .\\n \\nVery thin, portable, good looking drive\\n \\nI have been using various hard disks since many years. This one is by far the smallest, fastest and highest capacity drive of my lot. Fully recommended.\\n \\n1-Dec-2020,I received WD 5 TB Black My Passport HDD.On 13-Dec-2020,I made Backup of my Previous HDD Content,On 16-Dec-2020,When I plugged in my New WD 5 TB Black My Passport HDD i found all my Data to be Un-Reading/Un-Accessable/ Basically a Unformated Drive Pop up appeared. That means all my Data ... you know what i meant.The Amazon Return window was closed and all my Backup Data was lost.Did some troubleshooting and discovered,HDD Retains information till the time its connected to Laptop,Once HDD is Ejected (Using WD Discovery Software), & , Reconnected Back, Boom, All Data Gone.I called up WD, Told them everything, Performed Troubleshooting Steps on call and RMA Number was generated.I went to the WD Center, Gave them my Faulty HDD and,On 2-Jan-2021,Received a NEW WD 5 TB My Passport.TIP: Please use WD Drive Utilities and FORMAT YOUR HDD - TWICE, Even if the DATA is Un-Accessable, The Reason being there is BITS & BYTES of DATA on HDD, so FORMATing your HDD will give some peace of mind.

my detailed review, even though a bit lengthy is worth reading.👉 hdds vs ssds :**********************while none of the mechanical hdds can reach the blazing fast speeds of ssds in excess of 500 mb/s r/w, the hdds definitely offer a better value for money per mb of storage.also if data is corrupted in a ssd its almost never retrievable while in a hdd , there is always a hope depending upon extent of damage.🔷️ so for majority bulk backup - hdd are a better option to costlier ssds.👉 wd vs seagate :*********************this is again a topmost struggle making a decision.🔸️now both are giant reputed american storage brands & preference is mostly based upon personal usage experiences.🔸️i read somewhere that seagate offers better speeds& wd better reliability but i dont feel its true as speeds depend upon type of files being transferred & reliability upon manufacturing processes , which is hard to doubt for both brands.🔸️ regarding price wd is a bit costlier to seagate for same capacity.🔸️ both offer same warranties of 3 years.i had a wd failure & my friend had seagate failure - yet we both got replacements with data restored from their service centres.🔸️ regarding inbuilt software , i suppose wd is better as it comes with wd discovery that can link with all your social portals for backup too.🔷️ so you can go for any of these brands - wd being my personal favourite.🔷️ to ensure failsafe operation , testing for bad sectors before use ( using wd utility or any other hdd inspection software like hd sentinel etc ) is always a good idea.🔷️ store these drives horizontally in a dry case & not vertically or inclined , as in latter case the heads and platters tend to deform & get stuck.i learnt it the hard way.💝 i bought the latest 2019 4 tb passport drive and 3.63 tb of usable space was available in it.🔸️ the packing as usual was good enough with an instruction manual & 8 inches of connecting cable.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd enclosure is premium abs plastic which can surely withstand few non- severe slips & falls.a periphery cushioning or base padding with shock absorbent rubber would additionaly be great.4.2 /5 ⭐🔸️ the design & looks of this new drive aren't as elegant & classy, as previous passports & elements as my personal opinion.2/5 ⭐🔸️ the drive is very compact, sturdy & light weight too.5/5 ⭐🔸️ it was formatted in ntfs mode with 4096 bytes of allocation unit size.exfat is another option & you can play with allocation size also for better speeds but a bit less space.5/5 ⭐🔸️ with a mixed media & software file folder transfer of 5 gb , i registered - a write speed of 112 mb /s & a read speed of 160 mb /s on my hp omen core i7 configuration , which i suppose is fair enough for a mechanical hard drive.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the new hard disk has softwares for mac & windows backup both.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd has a very small point like white led indication for status & won't bother much in dark rooms.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd is very silent during operation & doesn't heat much even after few hours of backup.5/5 ⭐🔸️ warranty offered is 3 years which is contemporary to industry standards & similar to seagate.as already quoted earlier , i had one harddisk replaced & data restored in warranty like 6 years back by wd.so no issues there, noone is going to offer pick & drop at home - be assured.🤏 final verdict :**********************all in all , i have always been a wd guy & this new 2019 version further restores my faith in the same.\\n \\nwasn't able to transfer data from windows service pack 3 which was my main motive but over all product is very good. very light weight. transfer rate depends upon system you're using but generally between 30-60 mbps and in latest laptops (4-5 years old) speed is around 80 mbps.\\n \\ngood performance\\n \\ngood product, although would like to see how long it works without issue. hope the sellers are open to assist with warranty issues if needed.\\n \\nthis ssd is cheaper than 1tb ssd as price comparison. worth buying.\\n \\nafter 1 month it did not starting how can i claim this product warranty\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0i create youtube videos for my wife's cooking channel and storage has been a big want for us. i have a wd mycloud 2tb with a seagate 4tb backup plus as a backup and both required power, but i need a 4tb portable hard disk and ended up in buying this western digital 4tb my passport portable hard disk (new edition) for rs.8198.------------------------------------------------📦 in the box & hdd contents------------------------------------------------◾ 4tb blue portable harddisk in a bubble case◾ superspeed usb cable◾ quick install guide◾ wd discovery software for wd backup◾ wd security and wd drive utilities----------------------------------------🗓️ my usage & experience----------------------------------------the product has been manufactured in thailand and imported to india and this new edition wd my passport is supposed to have lesser failures and supposed to be more robust than the previous version.upon connecting 3.63tb was free and 297mb was used by the formatting of the disk which stores the disk geometry that allows hard disk to accept, store, and retrieve data. the hard disk was formatted with ntfs.this hard disk fits inside the palm of the hand and is quite small for a 4tb, 10.7cm length, 7.5cm breadth and 1.8cm depth, and is not heavy too.being a portable hard disk, it doesn’t require any power. i was able to connect it with my xbox, wd mycloud, laptop and desktop with ease and it detects quite fast.the write speeds were at 110 mb/s in actual and read speeds was around 115 mb/s. the disk reports were also almost similar at 120-127 mb/s. (see attached report). but the speeds changes depending on the free disk space, how much the disk is fragmented and whether there are any bad sectors, etc. this is quite impressive in my opinion.i didn't see any heating up issues with this new edition and temperature always remained under 37 degree c even under heavy writes in my testing with room temperature around 27- degree c.the wd discovery software is super cool, it can import files from social media and maintain a backup. just need to sign into facebook or instagram or dropbox, google drive or onedrive. it can also take a backup from wd mycloud devices.the wd security app provides a way to setup a password for the hard disk and contents can be encrypted, so when data is written it's encrypted and when data is read it's decrypted when password is used. i haven't tried any brute force recovery of data on this disk yet but the encryption seems to be good enough for home use. i didn't set the password as if password is forgotten i can't recover it back and only way to re-use the disk is by formatting.the hard disk has a small led indicator which can be turned off from the wd discovery settings if required.i was able to backup all my youtube video edits with ease and quickly, also was able to back up my dropbox.i don't see any cons as of now, and since i haven't contacted the customer service i can't comment on that part.-------------------------💖 what i liked-------------------------◾ 3 years warranty◾ good looking and light weight◾ automatic backup, password protection + 256bit encryption◾ fast read and write speeds-------------------🥇 overall-------------------a great hard disk at a good pricing. this new edition should be more stable and when take care well like not moving the hard disk while it being used, doing a safe eject of the hard disk, not dropping etc. this hard disk should last longer in my perspective, only time will tell. overall am happy with my purchase as it meets my expectations.\\n \\nvery beneficial\\n \\nthis is a very very early review. will definitely update after 6 days, if anything happens and then will try to update subsequently. now, coming to delivery, i am very pleased as it just arrive in one day. packaging wise, it was good, both outside and main packaging.  after i inserted the hdd, i got around 931 gb of free space, i download the apps and set my password, but could not register the product from the app. the speed initially, as can be seen from above photo, seems really good but let's see for how long it can maintain that speed. but, it has some sound inside, not annoying but upon bringing little closer to ear, you can hear it. don't know it's normal or not, so have to check it properly. rest, so far so good. but it's really damn light and very small.\\n \\npruchased it for one of my friend as i am from it filed and he asked me to do it for him. i have used wd portable and wd desktop drives for my personal use so i recommended this for him.\\n \\nvery nice harddisk 😊\\n \\ndidn't get any big discount for the independence day week purchase, but got it at 5.4k which is very less than what the local sellers quote. the size of this hard disk is very small and one can easily fit it into the front shirt pocket if they wanted to. it is very lightweight so you won't notice any issues while carrying it during travels.storage is 2tb but 1.81tb is what can be used.i have used it for 2 days now and i am getting around 112 to 130mb/s speed transfer using usb 3.0.i chose the color blue, but one side is still black while the front side is black.there is one cable provided for you to connect this to your pc but it is very small and because of that you need to keep it next to your port.wd provides 3 years warranty. you will be able to get a replacement for your broken hard drive if it stopped working for 3 years total. you need to register for it on their website. i don't think physical damage is considered under this 'limited warranty'.if it breaks, you'll lose your data. the replacement under warranty does not consider any data loss you'll have.overall, i am happy with my purchase. i wish i could've gotten more discount though!\\n \\ngood product\\n \\ngood product\\n \\nvalue for money\\n \\nbefore you pull out your pitchforks, i'm a big wd fan. i have been using their products for years and have yet to have a single hard drive failure. even my oldest powered 2tb wd my book drive from 2013 is still alive and kicking today. that being said, seagate products have learnt from their early mistakes and their hard drive are now more or less just as reliable as wd products (google: backblaze hard drive stats).however since wd have enjoyed their spot at the top, they don't feel like they need to provide anything more than the bare minimum so what you get when you buy a wd 5tb my passport is just the hard drive and a usb cable and nothing else, no extras for 8999 inr.however, with the seagate onetouch 5tb, for the same price, you also get a 1 year trial of mylio (a pretty cool self-hosted alternative of google photos), a 4 month trial of adobe creative cloud photography plan and 3 year rescue data recovery services. the last part is the one of the best perks of getting a seagate product. what it means is that over the 3 year warranty of your product, if your seagate hdd breaks down, you get 1 in-lab data recovery attempt by seagate for free.both wd and seagate will replace your hdd if it fails but seagate will also attempt full data recovery on the failed drive once during that 3-year warranty period which mind you, is a huge perk. data recovery services aren't cheap and generally cost like 10-20 times the value of the hdd itself.now coming to performance differences between the two, i'm attaching all the different tests i've conducted on both hard drive using crystaldiskmark 8. they're pretty much identical but wd has the lead over seagate for smaller file transfers while seagate does slightly better at large sequential file transfers.the wd drive was already formatted using ntfs while seagate was using exfat out of the box. after formatting the seagate hdd to ntfs, the sequential write performance decreased by around 5-10 mb/s. i hadn't encrypted the wd drive but the seagate was encrypted using the seagate toolkit (which may or may not have contributed to some performance decrease, i don't know).\\n \\n1st one was not working! got easy replacement! kudos to the seller. ultra portable, good form factor.\\n \\n2tb capacity, fast transfer speed, bought the case separatelyit's my 2nd 2tb external hdd. totally worth to keep backup of personal photography files and its compact and palm sized.effective usable capacity 1.81tb.\\n \\nthere's a huge debate about which external hard disk is the best as there are many brands getting famous in india after sony stopped exporting hard disks here! sony is the best among all the other brands, no debate! but after sony i think wd is the next best, since seagate, toshiba and other brands aren't good for long term, durability is most important factor according to me in hard disks ofc and i think wd is most durable among the available options!\\n \\ngot 2tb (actually 1.8 tb) at a discount for less than 5k. working okay for last 3 months. waiting to see how long this works without issue.\\n \\nthose who

1-folder at a time and it worked.[2] this is very bad and need every time care:after safely removing drive from windows system tray, windows shows all good to disconnect, but the hdd still has led continuously flickering for 3-7 seconds or perhaps more. i had to wait for the led to completly unglow for 5+ seconds before disconnecting from usb port. the led is not bright, thus it will be difficult to notice this everytime unplug being performed.[3] warranty registration:only received email showing product serial number got registered successfully. the dates of purchase are all blank

light.getting constant 110 mbps speed.it's just plug and play.got it for my studies and i am happy with the purchase.\\n \\ngood product\\n \\ngood to carrying on pocket\\n \\ni have bought hard drives from all 3 major hard drive manufacturing companies-toshiba,western digital and seagate and i have to say that my experience with western digital has been the worst out of all of them.firstly, i would talk about the performance of the drive. honestly,it is terrible! when i first bought the drive an year ago, it used to give me max 90 mb/s r/w speeds on my older laptop with usb 3.0 port(very rarely reaching 100 mb/s at times). the thing is that happened only in the initial few months of using the drive. after that the max speeds never really reached that high(only very rarely or occasionally). it now stays in the range of 30-70 mb/s(very variable speeds at times). compare that to toshiba and seagate, with toshiba i get around 80-153 mb/s read/write speeds with it usually staying in the high speed category(110mb/s+, 130mb/s average with it hitting 147 mb/s very frequently),even after filling most of the drive and using it for quite long(talking in refernce to toshiba canvio gaming, i have heard similar praises and also tried other canvio drives too and they perform the best among the competition). with seagate, i get consistent r/w speeds usually around 133 mb/s(key point being consistent). i haven't tested seagate fully(also it being newer) but from initial impressions i can say that it's miles beyond wd one(i have seagate expansion drive new). also point to be noted is that western digital drive performance decreases with more data being stored on it. one reason for such major performance impact maybe it's hardware encryption, as quite some users have pointed out on the internet that hard drive encryption can slow down speeds(with wd drive having hardware encryption by default).secondly,the drive heats up a lot even when it's idle. after an year of using it, when copying files from wd to other drive it many a times sits at around 80% active time(meaning the drive is not working to it's full capacity). idle temps on the drive hover above the 42c mark(noticed it after an year of using it) which is quite hot to touch. while in operation it easily crosses 50c(i could only cool it by keeping it above a cooling pad). one thing however is that seagate drives also get hot but they do so slowly and quickly dial back in temp when they are not on load, which doesn't happen with wd(temp stays high for a very long time). thermal insulation on wd drive is also very bad, you can feel the heat directly by touching the drive(no insulation) and the bottom part being the hottest. with seagate(expansion drive) you can feel the heat only on a small part on the bottom in the new design. with toshiba gaming drive the top part is completely heat isolated and only the bottom part gets hot(which can sometimes be misleading but toshiba does the job well). the toshiba drives also remain a lot cooler than both seagate and wd drives and also dissipate heat a lot faster.thirdly,wd my passport drives are very prone to fragmentation and it is ridiculously hard to defragment at times. i could only get defraggler to get to defrag the drive with all other defrag programs refusing to even touch the drive. defrag times shows well over 3h for a 100gb defrag(other drives do this in minutes).update:i also checked my laptop internal wd blue drive and it also performs horribly like the external one however it's performance is more consistent. in general wd drives are not very good performance wise(esp external).based on the above points my recommendation would be to buy other company's drives. only buy this one if you are not concerned about heat,poor performance etc.\\n \\ni have ordered wd passport 1tb hardrive, when it got delivered, i have opened it with lot of excitement but i could see the product's box itself too old and it's teared off, and obviously it's used by someone and returned or something else. after seeing that i didn't even get a feel of opening the box, i felt like paying money for new and getting second hand product and i have starightaway messaged the costomer care. they have agreed for the refund (product only eligible for replacement) and they felt sorry for the issue aswell. and i have ordered another one freshly and it got delivered today and it looks so cool and new and gives good feel. and i used it aswell, it's so light and fast, yet to discover more.\\n \\ni received a product

\\nver very good\\n \\ngood product\\n \\nthe product was just okay lot of the time it won't show in laptop and the password protection was garbage. in built software for password protection is useless it didn't even recognise device lot of the time. files transfer speed was also very low for this price rage. wd disappoints me a lot.\\n \\nspeed and design is good.\\n \\nbest company good product. i used since 2010.\\n \\nokay, first things first. if you are buying this particular model of hdd, be sure to get an alexvyan shockproof case with it. if you accidentally drop it, you will lose all of your precious data. also, despite what another person says in their review, do not enable write cacheing, unless you want to end up with an expensive brick, when you inadvertently remove this hdd from your pc without using 'safely remove hardware'.now, on to the product itself. i first bought this hdd in august 2020. i don't know if amazon sent me a faulty product or if i was careless, but the hdd went kaput in the first month of usage. rma'ing it was a breeze, but i lost all of my precious data, and data recovery prices are through the roof. as far as storage goes, you won't get better than wd. the read and write speeds aren't half-bad either. but you will need to handle your hdd with the utmost caution to avoid any sort of damage or data loss. use only for storage and backup. if using as a storage device for your plex library, make sure you always keep it on a flat surface, and be sure to periodically disconnect it from your computer to avoid physical damage or reallocated sectors.as far as form factor and looks, an all-black serrated design looks very pristine, though i'd prefer to go for the red colour next time when going for my next wd hdd. the hdd isn't lightweight, and to make things worse is extremely slippery, very heavy and has a bad centre of gravity. hence my words about careful handling apply even further.tl;dr great hdd for the storage, average to good read/write speeds, but if you prefer something more rugged, go for seagate and do a full format from the default exfat to ntfs.edit: i'd also like to point out that the data security feature is mega useless. it encrypts the whole hard drive with a password, rather than certain folders, and this sometimes results in computers being unable to read the drive. better to use bitlocker, or maybe don't give your hdd to anyone, much less people who would snoop around, looking at your 'private' files.\\n \\ni received product as same as they said in product specs..transfer rate also

storage space and transfer speeds, it's the supremely sleek design and wd software support that makes this product unique.i personally loved the red variant of all. the red - black dual color combination with matt finish just makes the whole hardrive design very minimalistic. if you are person who want to carry light and smart, this product perfectly suits it. though it's named passport, it's much smaller than a passport. fits easily in the palm and does slip out easily.-----------------------⏩⏩ box contents:-----------------------1 western digital passport, 1 data cable and 1 user

from few months, working very good till now..reading /writing very smooth ..\\n \\nnice...\\n \\nproduct is good it's looking nice .\\n \\nits comapct handy and fairly quick, real easy to use.\\n \\nthe product has some minor scratches on the body a small little that is only the drawback i experienced\\n \\nvery light and a large storage.\\n \\ni used for 1year for a very little duration .... recently i started using a little bit more for my sister's marriage pics and videos 400gb i stored and when i thought of copying it into laptop the hard disc was not detecting by  any system.....i took it to the computer service centre they diagonise and said the media driver was gone for a toss......now all my data was gone within few days....now am not sure even the data recovery centre can retrieve the data.....so be careful guys\\n \\nwd quality is good and performance is as per expectations so far .( 3months of usage)\\n \\nwhen received, i tested for some 90gb transfer of files, seems to be functioning excellent. will try another transfer of files and let you know later, if any malfunctions or any other. otherwise it will be good.\\n \\nreceived as expected\\n \\nsmaller than iphone 12 but with 5tb capacity, no external power source. a wonderful piece of tech with only 8k price. using it 6months now. read write speed more than 100 mbps. very well recommended.\\n \\nit's been a wonderful device since the time i've first purchased it couple of years ago.  the storage you get is around 3.63 tb and due to my heavy usage it's already coming to it's full capacity lol.  overall, i don't have much complaints not have faced any issues till now.\\n \\nnice product\\n \\nthe build quality is good especially the new and compact design like before the wd hard drive used to be a heavy and thick one but this one is really slim easy to carry light weight.copy speed is up to :- 110-120mbps which is good 👍\\n \\ni have only used up to half the full drive capacity and the read write performance still feels good as new without any signs of slowing. i deliberately chose a larger drive than my intended usage capacity as these drives tend to slow down as they get full.\\n \\nit's still working superb...and data transfer speed is good....light weight....totally fine product....\\n \\ngreat\\n \\nafter all its a hard disk, nothing so special. yeah it does the work perfectly, no worries.\\n \\nvery fast and handy gorgeous light weight\\n \\nlight weight, colour, storage  capacity nice\\n \\nwd is good brand hard-disk . . .\\n \\n- 1.81 tb of usable storage for 2tb hard drive.- i could see copying speeds up to 118mb/s.- the hard drive is really compact and lightweight. i wasn't expecting it to be this compact.- loved the build quality and the textured finish of the product.- absolutely no issue at connecting to various devices.- the chord is relatively short. but does the job pretty well.rest all is pretty standard, and as described in the about section of the product.an easy recommendation for anyone who is looking to buy a hard drive.\\n \\nit is about my experience.light weight, easy portability, and i space is as mentioned.pros:i am unable to register\\n \\nbest for this price\\n \\nvery good product\\n \\nthe software on the hdd won't install or has problems. one has to visit the website. it's a bit confusing. for backup had to install from their website.\\n \\ni have been buyers of western digital products for a long time. the seals/packing of wd external hard drives should be made more strong and reliable. even some packets i have received in semi-open. packing of products can be easily opened. see picture.\\n \\nquality and storage and spped are good\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0the product stopped working today idk what's happened can u replace it ?\\n \\nthe moment i tried to connect the hdd, the device started huge noise as if there the internal fan of a cooler was switched on. i didn't expect the noise/sound from a hdd. i had a wd hdd which was working fine and without noise. i was surprised that the new one had this issue. the second issue was accessing the hdd. initial few times i got a popup asking to format the drive and when i tried to format i got an error message that the format failed due to an error. i started to doubt if this was really a new piece or a refurbished piece. sellers do have a habit of cheating the customers by getting rid of defective pieces first. i believe that happened today as well. overall, the hdd is working fine now though it gave me some initial trouble. there is an occasional noise from the hdd and i don't know the reason for that. i'm not that happy because of this experience of buying electronic product online. this definitely makes me remember before i decide to order an electronic product again.\\n \\nআমি বিগত দুই বছরে নিজস্ব ব্যবহারের জন্য wd harddisk  চারটে কিনেছি । খুব ভালো সার্ভিস । সব থকে বড় ব্যাপার হল আজ অবধি কোন ডেটা মিসিং হয়নি কিম্বা ক্রাক হয়নি । ধন্যবাদ ।\\n \\nvery good product.\\n \\neasy to handle light weight  external hard disk  and data transfer speed also very good  .\\n \\ncoping speed is ok\\n \\ni am using this product for daily cleaning of sofas, wall dusting\\n \\nthis is my 1st time purchasing an external hdd, i chose wd reading all those reviews and hearing their prompt services, anyway so i transferred almost 40gb stuffs from my laptop to this hdd and the transfer speed was around 70mbps on average and took me nearly 6 minutes, i was expecting it to touch over 100mbps mark as it has usb 3 but anyway... the product is extremely light weight and small, great for portability\\n \\nna\\n \\nedit 13rd week of 2021the looks are just fine. usually these devices come as plug and play, but this time i couldn't figure out what the issue is. my pc recognizes this device as does my previous wd hdd. but i couldn't use the new one. as seen in the image, it shows as unallocated space in the disk partition, and i cant make it to work. this is highly unusual and let's see what amazon will do for this.edit 24th week of 2021amazon amazes me as usual.. got a brand new one for my faulty drive, within the replacement window without much hassle.and abt the new drive, it sure is a cool one. yet to check the speeds and other info. with 4.54 tb space from my 5tb drive, i will update as soon as it passes the test for bad sectors.. and i would recommend doing that mandatorily for new drives.pros1 good looking, taking very small space and light in weight2 good built quality3 doesn't make much noise.cons1 very small led notification light.2 slight heating up during checking phase.on the whole, just like the marvel and dc fued, don't get confused over segate and this, because years of my experience has made it clear that wd is reliable and stays with you for years to come, given you handle it properly..just check for the bad sectors when u get it new and just plug and play..will update after further usage..\\n \\nwith usb 2.0 it gives a transfer rate of about 22 mbps. although it keeps on varying from 1 mbps to 22 mbps. with usb 3.0 port it gives a transfer rate of about 40 to 50 mbps. at one point of time ii also got a transfer rate of about 70 mbps. my laptop has usb 2.0 port so it gave about 20 mbps. at first i thought of returning it but when i used it in usb 3.0 port, it gave 40 mbps transfer rate. after searching on net, i found that every harddisk gives this much transfer rate although they mention speeds in gbps but that's all theoretical. so if you want to buy a harddisk you can go for this as it's durabilty and serviceability is high as compared to other brands. also it is very small in size and hence portable.also, you will get a storage of 931 gb although it has a storage of 1 tb.\\n \\nthis is great for backups and exchange data with friends and family members but only thing is i cannot connect it with my samsung galaxy phone they should provide an additional software for connecting it to android devices\\n \\nsuper\\n \\ngetting very slow transfer speed\\n \\n1)transfer speed is 110 to 120 mb, don't expect hight rate transfer speed above one is maximum  speed i noticed while transfering data from laptop to hard disk.2) design is too good.3) really slim and fit into pocket also.4) compatiability is nice.5) packaging is tight and crisp.6) deliver time packaging was good from amazon.7) data security also given in the hard disk.8) i purchased in ₹4444 2tb hard disk.you can

5tb.the actual capacity is 4.5 tb.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0the purpose of wd 4tb  my passport is to be a backup drive of your data. it is well designed for the purpose. i have had many wd products in the past and they have been very reliable. i want to share some great features about this product1. storage capacity i have bought wd 4tb my passport portable external hard drive, blue - with automatic backup, 256bit aes hardware encryption & software protection2. transfer speedthe wd my passport 4tb comes with a portable hard drive and a high speed usb 3.0 connector. the portable storage comes with a 3 year warrantyi had no problem transferring both large files taking several minutes and many many smaller files in large batches back and forth between pc and drive.3. portability and durabilityit's small size and light weight make it great for traveling and being able to grab and go and it won't take up much desk space. i highly recommend the my passport.there’s also an option to save backups to a cloud service such a dropbox so you don’t have to worry about bringing the drive with you everywhere.4. securitythe drive comes with wd discovery for either windows and mac. you can set up the hardware encryption with this app. with the encryption software, you can set a password so that whenever you access the hard drive you have to enter the password. you can protect your private data. you can set up scheduled backups through the app. you cannot schedule it through windows if you have hard drive encryption enabled5. compatibilitypreloaded on the drive is a pair of install wrappers for western digital’s discovery dashboard – one for windows and one for mac. running them should, ideally, download the latest version of the utility from the internet and install it on your machine (go to western digital’s support website and download it from there before it would actually work.) this then lets you install 3 basic apps: one for backups, another for security management, and one for maintenance and health monitoring of the drive.6. gamingusb 3.0 is quite important here as the speed can affect its waiting time and game responsiveness. this drive comes with usb 3.0 that matches the speed of ssd also it matches ps4 colours.only con is there is no usb type c.overall, if you need an affordable portable drive as storage expansion or for backing up your computer, you will find my passport 4tb is an easy and safe choice.\\n \\nbeen using it for a couple of months now, no issues so far. i also edit photos from it, speed is good enough for that.\\n \\ngood...\\n \\nstorage capacity is good but not working properly\\n \\njust check for the bad sectors after purchasing and i think the write speed is low\\n \\nnot responding with laptops it's damage pic and your agency tack back product and not replaced new one or not refund payment please solve problem\\n \\namazon asked me what i liked or disliked while writing the review.dislike: my first order for this product (seller appario) was a fake one. when i held the hard disk it felt lightweight, on connecting it to two laptops on different ports the light would switch on however the disk drive would never show. the hard disk didn't vibrate (rotating disks were not felt). the disk management of windows didn't detect it too. it simply showed up in task bar as 'my passport 6267'. upon checking usb drivers it showed 'code 43: set address failed'. seems a pretty famous error if you look it up on google. checked the s/n on wd site and it showed warranty till 2024. strange. tried to update drivers, but no success. finally put it in replacement.like: same seller this time sent original product. got 3.63 tb usable out of 4 tb. write speeds are ~117 mb/s (copying from hdd to laptop or reverse, both same). hard disk is really portable and i liked the colour options. bought a case for it as well (separate positive review on that too.)thank you.\\n \\none of the best options available in the market. portable, lightweight, cross-device compatible and value for money.test with my realme gt master edition (android phone) over otg. working fine.transfer speed is upto 80-100mbps on 7200rpm hdd with amd ryzen 7 5600h (windows 11)\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0amazing product with good quality and looks awesome\\n \\ni am using this drive for past one year and it served me well.i have been using it to carry my data as carrying my gaming laptop to my collage is quite hard.the drive is quite reliable when it comes to speed. the speed is good.it offer some great security for the price as it offers hardware based security at this price point.if you are looking for a slim, reliable and secure hdd then you can't go wrong with this one.its a open recommendation from me just go for it.\\n \\nthe drives look very nice, and are half as thick as my old wd drives with the same capacity. transfer speed is about the same. but these drives are noisy! i have two of them. and i haven't had such noise drives since the 90's when i could hear my disk drive. i just use them for backups so i don't care, but its a surprise that considering older wd drives don't make so much noise, these do. i doubt i received a defective one, because i have two drives, and both are noisy. this is just the way they are.\\n \\nyes its light weighted.its too small in size u can carry in palm easly.\\n \\nnice product\\n \\ngreat deal at its price\\n \\nportable and the right size\\n \\nnice, less noisy , good speed\\n \\ncolour is white and somewhat little storage due to internal aap installation.\\n \\nvery comprehensive lightweight nice

\\nit is handy and has good storage capacity. copy speed is okay, will recommend this product to everyone.\\n \\nwell, it's good but you should go for one with type cit can easily give speed of 120mbps write speedsome will find problem like writing speed is 25mbps but there is a solution for that...some people may find problem with connectivity that it's not showing in your pc or something like that but it's not a huge problem at all you just do one thing go on youtube and search your problem will be solved...it's compact and lightweight in this segmenti'm not talking about ssdssds are very light than hddbut in hdd segment it's comparatively light\\n \\nit is better... lightweight... portable...nice design... storage is about 1.8t....transfer speed is quite good... quality is good...comes with password protection... backup and some more features...overall satisfied with the product.\\n \\nwd is best to choose among other brands it's not like other brands are bad but considering every aspect of wd that includes service,product quality,longivity etc wd is best and wd failure rate is lower compare to seagate and other brands actually quality defers from region to region guys and for those who are complaining about disk not working etc etc plz don't try to plug and unplug the cable to hdd more no of times cuz the brands are made them worst by manufacturing the inside drive as a soldered to motherboard and it's not good when u plug and unplug many times roughly then the solder will loose its grip and may break from motherboard so use it delicately and we request the ext hdd manufacturers to bring back the old sata type connection not this crappy soldered models... and the reading speed writing speed are as usual 120-140mbps in usb 3.0 & 3.1 interface ... thank u wd and amazons intime delivery and package is awesome.\\n \\ngood product nice\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\nread write speed are almost same 120 mbps... though some vedios shows 4-5 gbps transfer rate from hard disk to pc but i never got that speed  even though i have a  thunder bolt port and usb 3.2 gen 1 port.. in both speed are the same good for average speed transfer\\n \\nit is not supporting ps4.\\n \\ngood\\n \\nwhen i recieved it i was happy i had earlie purcahe red one which spins a lots even afater safely remove this one not seems.i tested it usign hdd regenration and then hdd tune pro again 5 time i tested for surface test usign hdd sentinel scanning took in usb 3 only 4 hours 20 mins and scannign in hdd regenratio 5 hours 20 min that insane  in usb 3 i means else it ould hav kten 2 days in usb 2.0 .and transfer speed i means i copied my old wd 4tb files to this  i put in usb 2 that old wd 4tb and tranfer somver 800 gb and the speed was averatge 37mb/sec .this hardisk was attachd in usb 3 .normally the speed might reach 200 mb /sec if connected both in usb 3 or even more as scannign speed during surface test and otehr test shows that speed 240 mb/sec.hpe it lasts more than5 yeas as i had one wd drive interal still over 1750 days runtime stil no errors another wd i purcahsed in sep 2014 1 tb wd passport ultra from amazon used occasional still no badsector .wd are reliable .just need to be carefully if so many chuk files like photos and all corrupts the mft table as large amount of files they are i mean photos and all small files .if large fiels i had less no of file count ..the mft get corrupted.use paragon hardisk manager to compact mft .and it works again.still never believe a hardisk it can' fail any time alwasys keep backup copy 3-2-1 rule .keep mft record of that hardisk using wiztree software (mft dump ) you can use to analyse if hardisk get corrputed or data recovery time .\\n \\ngood storage capacity\\n \\nit has enough space for my movies and game storage. it has great speed and .the design is simple and super. i really loved the product .\\n \\nnothing\\n \\nit's so small just fight to pocket data transfer is speed as compared to my old sony. till now it's performance is nice. perfect for daily use and travelling perpose\\n \\nbest external hdd with enough capacity to store. more importantly, oraganized files rather than junk. else, you'll keep crying for more storage even after having 4tb of storage space.\\n \\nwent for this passport hd storage due to wd's reputation, even though my experience with an earlier wd elements drive was not that great.issues with passport drive:1. wd discovery did not install initially. i tried on 2 separate computers running win 10. it would install till 18% and then not proceed. this is a known issue if you search on the net. surprising that wd hasn't fixed it yet.2. following the workarounds managed to install wd discovery. next the wd backup app didn't install. this too had to be worked around before was finally able to install it.3. transferring files took ages. got error messages for several files (documents, images etc), which didn't get copied.4. the transferred files and folders on the drive did not display when i attached the drive to my other computer. that was the main reason i got the drive, to be able to have the files in one place to use on several computers!conclusion: installing, running and transferring files was very time consuming and frustrating.  it's better to install other software for backup/transferring files. much faster and more reliable.am unlikely to go with any wd products again.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\ngood\\n \\ndrive got corrupted even though i was careful with the usage. fortunately, i got it replaced.\\n \\ni love this hard disk it's quite compact and easy to use. i have kept my data on this disk have not got any issues regarding data corruption or any other issues so far. it also have a feature to encrypt the disk with password which tightens the data security.\\n \\nwriting review for a replacement drive after the first one failed very shortly within a day of using it. suddenly after a while the drive started to make loud fan-like noise with lots of clicking sounds(the drive head trying to copy/fetch data) and finally after sometime i heard the 'click of death' (google it if you want to know more) and the drive stopped getting recognized by windows and the os stopped responding whenever this drive was plugged in. i googled and got to know that it happens when there are bad sectors detected or mechanical failure inside. luckily after sometime i was able to copy back the data from the drive to my local existing internal hdd drive and immediately asked for replacement. thanks a lot to amazon for getting it quickly replaced by a new drive.i used a software recommend by western digital to check the health of the drive - data lifeguard diagnostic for windows. great software to check for problems with any hdd.works fine when there are no mechanical problems inside and is light weight and portable too. have to be a little more careful while handling it because of it's size.\\n \\ncontains much more space that i could save my whole laptop data at once!!! must have…\\n \\ni got a storage capacity of 1.8gb that’s a bit low on the product and the security software is not concluded have to download it separately again overall the product is fine slim and elegant\\n \\nwas in a dilemma whether to buy wd or seagate - they are both equally reputable in this space. post analysis settled for this version of the my passport has it seemed like it was good in terms of value for money. in terms of the seller, no issues.however, wd passport ( and i'm assuming all the other external hard disks) have some serious compatible issues with mac. in my case, i was on a high serrier version os and my passport was not being detected by mac. after alot of research across wd website, forums, blogs etc - i figured out that it's a very common issue with alot of folks worldwide. in the end, i had to upgrade to the latest os ( big sur), download wd utilities and post some messing around, it magically got detected.once, its detected there are no issues and works great !\\n \\nno words than the bestest drive in the market. i have already used all other brandsbut it's the best ever\\n \\noverall it was good. no problem in product. perfectly fine but the cover in which it was sent was broken. i did not complain as product was ok.\\n \\nthe wd is best for making storage hard drives.pros:1. i got product on time and started using it from same day. till now no issues.2.100mbps+ read speed with usb 3.0 only.3. write speed is little slow(max 30mbps).cons:1. the only drawback is, it give you 4500gb space instead of 5120gb and as you know 10% of drive need to be empty to get better performance. that means 450gb is useless and you actually get 4tb for proper usage while you paid for 5tb space.2. the wd have a contest to fool you (at least by this seller). the same hdd is on amazon without that scratch coupon , it have free hdd portable cover worth of rs.1000.3. also that wd software which comes inside hdd is useless, as in regular usage you don't need such software's. i agree in initial days of usage you might face some hdd detection issues, but that are just usb driver specific only.(you need to update usb drivers if needed)conclusion: don't get fool for laptop and go with hdd which have free cover and also try to research on which hdd give you more space (i.e wd4tb,2tb,1tb or any other brand with good storage) and go with it no matter which brand .\\n \\nvery thin, portable, good looking drive\\n \\ni have been using various hard disks since many years. this one is by far the smallest, fastest and highest capacity drive of my lot. fully recommended.\\n \\n1-dec-2020,i received wd 5 tb black my passport hdd.on 13-dec-2020,i made backup of my previous hdd content,on 16-dec-2020,when i plugged in my new wd 5 tb black my passport hdd i found all my data to be un-reading/un-accessable/ basically a unformated drive pop up appeared. that means all my data ... you know what i meant.the amazon return window was closed and all my backup data was lost.did some troubleshooting and discovered,hdd retains information till the time its connected to laptop,once hdd is ejected (using wd discovery software), & , reconnected back, boom, all data gone.i called up wd, told them everything, performed troubleshooting steps on call and rma number was generated.i went to the wd center, gave them my faulty hdd and,on 2-jan-2021,received a new wd 5 tb my passport.tip: please use wd drive utilities and format your hdd - twice, even if the data is un-accessable, the reason being there is bits & bytes of data on hdd, so formating your hdd will give some peace of mind. remember- format (dont do quick format.)wd service was appreciated a lot, even though red color hdd was bit querky !!by the way: please check wd official website for accurate toll free number.\\n \\ngood one i am very happy\\n \\nproduct is handy, fast & easy to connect\\n \\nnice but it's very costly\\n \\nnice product and worth to money\\n \\nnice one light weight\\n \\nwd security software is not working, els good!\\n \\nnice product! using for storing educational videos for my son. very

hard drives before this from local electronics store,none had such issues..wd itself is a very good brand in terms of reliability and performance,i have 2 more from the same brand,but the first time i am having this issue..when the amazon delivery guy handed me this item he fished it out from the bottom of the rucksack(he dropped the rucksack to the floor from above 2.5 feet before fishing the hdd out)..these items are malhandled by these delivery guys without any sensitivity to the nature of the content,that is why broken coffee mugs,books with the spine and corners broken et cetera are the most returned items on amazon..good seller,handling of delivery of sensitive equipments by amazon delivery guy is below par although..should not blame the seller for that..none of the electronic goods i bought from appario retail ever gave me trouble but the hdd i have bought this time is making a weird sound every 3 seconds like a hiccup..the delivery people don't have any sensitivity when it comes to handling delicate items(except for mobile phones maybe)..for other electronics items they adopt a go-to-hell-for-all-i-care attitude..1-these items should not be placed at the bottom of the heap(they did in this case)2-these items should not be subjected to dropping from a height(while getting it out of the heavy rucksack packed to the brim the delivery guy dropped the rucksack from waist level to the floor,about 2.5 feet drop..add to that the weight of other irems on top of it and do the math)i have already asked for a replacement for this item..waiting to see how that works26th november,update:the replacement is working fine.\\n \\nlightweight, portable drive, good for media and doc storage. good data transfer speeds\\n \\ngood\\n\""

my detailed review, even though a bit lengthy is worth reading.👉 hdds vs ssds :**********************while none of the mechanical hdds can reach the blazing fast speeds of ssds in excess of 500 mb/s r/w, the hdds definitely offer a better value for money per mb of storage.also if data is corrupted in a ssd its almost never retrievable while in a hdd , there is always a hope depending upon extent of damage.🔷️ so for majority bulk backup - hdd are a better option to costlier ssds.👉 wd vs seagate :*********************this is again a topmost struggle making a decision.🔸️now both are giant reputed american storage brands & preference is mostly based upon personal usage experiences.🔸️i read somewhere that seagate offers better speeds& wd better reliability but i dont feel its true as speeds depend upon type of files being transferred & reliability upon manufacturing processes , which is hard to doubt for both brands.🔸️ regarding price wd is a bit costlier to seagate for same capacity.🔸️ both offer same warranties of 3 years.i had a wd failure & my friend had seagate failure - yet we both got replacements with data restored from their service centres.🔸️ regarding inbuilt software , i suppose wd is better as it comes with wd discovery that can link with all your social portals for backup too.🔷️ so you can go for any of these brands - wd being my personal favourite.🔷️ to ensure failsafe operation , testing for bad sectors before use ( using wd utility or any other hdd inspection software like hd sentinel etc ) is always a good idea.🔷️ store these drives horizontally in a dry case & not vertically or inclined , as in latter case the heads and platters tend to deform & get stuck.i learnt it the hard way.💝 i bought the latest 2019 4 tb passport drive and 3.63 tb of usable space was available in it.🔸️ the packing as usual was good enough with an instruction manual & 8 inches of connecting cable.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd enclosure is premium abs plastic which can surely withstand few non- severe slips & falls.a periphery cushioning or base padding with shock absorbent rubber would additionaly be great.4.2 /5 ⭐🔸️ the design & looks of this new drive arent as elegant & classy, as previous passports & elements as my personal opinion.2/5 ⭐🔸️ the drive is very compact, sturdy & light weight too.5/5 ⭐🔸️ it was formatted in ntfs mode with 4096 bytes of allocation unit size.exfat is another option & you can play with allocation size also for better speeds but a bit less space.5/5 ⭐🔸️ with a mixed media & software file folder transfer of 5 gb , i registered - a write speed of 112 mb /s & a read speed of 160 mb /s on my hp omen core i7 configuration , which i suppose is fair enough for a mechanical hard drive.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the new hard disk has softwares for mac & windows backup both.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd has a very small point like white led indication for status & wont bother much in dark rooms.5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd is very silent during operation & doesnt heat much even after few hours of backup.5/5 ⭐🔸️ warranty offered is 3 years which is contemporary to industry standards & similar to seagate.as already quoted earlier , i had one harddisk replaced & data restored in warranty like 6 years back by wd.so no issues there, noone is going to offer pick & drop at home - be assured.🤏 final verdict :**********************all in all , i have always been a wd guy & this new 2019 version further restores my faith in the same.\\n \\nwasnt able to transfer data from windows service pack 3 which was my main motive but over all product is very good. very light weight. transfer rate depends upon system youre using but generally between 30-60 mbps and in latest laptops (4-5 years old) speed is around 80 mbps.\\n \\ngood performance\\n \\ngood product, although would like to see how long it works without issue. hope the sellers are open to assist with warranty issues if needed.\\n \\nthis ssd is cheaper than 1tb ssd as price comparison. worth buying.\\n \\nafter 1 month it did not starting how can i claim this product warranty\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0i create youtube videos for my wifes cooking channel and storage has been a big want for us. i have a wd mycloud 2tb with a seagate 4tb backup plus as a backup and both required power, but i need a 4tb portable hard disk and ended up in buying this western digital 4tb my passport portable hard disk (new edition) for rs.8198.------------------------------------------------📦 in the box & hdd contents------------------------------------------------◾ 4tb blue portable harddisk in a bubble case◾ superspeed usb cable◾ quick install guide◾ wd discovery software for wd backup◾ wd security and wd drive utilities----------------------------------------🗓️ my usage & experience----------------------------------------the product has been manufactured in thailand and imported to india and this new edition wd my passport is supposed to have lesser failures and supposed to be more robust than the previous version.upon connecting 3.63tb was free and 297mb was used by the formatting of the disk which stores the disk geometry that allows hard disk to accept, store, and retrieve data. the hard disk was formatted with ntfs.this hard disk fits inside the palm of the hand and is quite small for a 4tb, 10.7cm length, 7.5cm breadth and 1.8cm depth, and is not heavy too.being a portable hard disk, it doesn’t require any power. i was able to connect it with my xbox, wd mycloud, laptop and desktop with ease and it detects quite fast.the write speeds were at 110 mb/s in actual and read speeds was around 115 mb/s. the disk reports were also almost similar at 120-127 mb/s. (see attached report). but the speeds changes depending on the free disk space, how much the disk is fragmented and whether there are any bad sectors, etc. this is quite impressive in my opinion.i didnt see any heating up issues with this new edition and temperature always remained under 37 degree c even under heavy writes in my testing with room temperature around 27- degree c.the wd discovery software is super cool, it can import files from social media and maintain a backup. just need to sign into facebook or instagram or dropbox, google drive or onedrive. it can also take a backup from wd mycloud devices.the wd security app provides a way to setup a password for the hard disk and contents can be encrypted, so when data is written its encrypted and when data is read its decrypted when password is used. i havent tried any brute force recovery of data on this disk yet but the encryption seems to be good enough for home use. i didnt set the password as if password is forgotten i cant recover it back and only way to re-use the disk is by formatting.the hard disk has a small led indicator which can be turned off from the wd discovery settings if required.i was able to backup all my youtube video edits with ease and quickly, also was able to back up my dropbox.i dont see any cons as of now, and since i havent contacted the customer service i cant comment on that part.-------------------------💖 what i liked-------------------------◾ 3 years warranty◾ good looking and light weight◾ automatic backup, password protection + 256bit encryption◾ fast read and write speeds-------------------🥇 overall-------------------a great hard disk at a good pricing. this new edition should be more stable and when take care well like not moving the hard disk while it being used, doing a safe eject of the hard disk, not dropping etc. this hard disk should last longer in my perspective, only time will tell. overall am happy with my purchase as it meets my expectations.\\n \\nvery beneficial\\n \\nthis is a very very early review. will definitely update after 6 days, if anything happens and then will try to update subsequently. now, coming to delivery, i am very pleased as it just arrive in one day. packaging wise, it was good, both outside and main packaging.  after i inserted the hdd, i got around 931 gb of free space, i download the apps and set my password, but could not register the product from the app. the speed initially, as can be seen from above photo, seems really good but lets see for how long it can maintain that speed. but, it has some sound inside, not annoying but upon bringing little closer to ear, you can hear it. dont know its normal or not, so have to check it properly. rest, so far so good. but its really damn light and very small.\\n \\npruchased it for one of my friend as i am from it filed and he asked me to do it for him. i have used wd portable and wd desktop drives for my personal use so i recommended this for him.\\n \\nvery nice harddisk 😊\\n \\ndidnt get any big discount for the independence day week purchase, but got it at 5.4k which is very less than what the local sellers quote. the size of this hard disk is very small and one can easily fit it into the front shirt pocket if they wanted to. it is very lightweight so you wont notice any issues while carrying it during travels.storage is 2tb but 1.81tb is what can be used.i have used it for 2 days now and i am getting around 112 to 130mb/s speed transfer using usb 3.0.i chose the color blue, but one side is still black while the front side is black.there is one cable provided for you to connect this to your pc but it is very small and because of that you need to keep it next to your port.wd provides 3 years warranty. you will be able to get a replacement for your broken hard drive if it stopped working for 3 years total. you need to register for it on their website. i dont think physical damage is considered under this limited warranty.if it breaks, youll lose your data. the replacement under warranty does not consider any data loss youll have.overall, i am happy with my purchase. i wish i couldve gotten more discount though!\\n \\ngood product\\n \\ngood product\\n \\nvalue for money\\n \\nbefore you pull out your pitchforks, im a big wd fan. i have been using their products for years and have yet to have a single hard drive failure. even my oldest powered 2tb wd my book drive from 2013 is still alive and kicking today. that being said, seagate products have learnt from their early mistakes and their hard drive are now more or less just as reliable as wd products (google: backblaze hard drive stats).however since wd have enjoyed their spot at the top, they dont feel like they need to provide anything more than the bare minimum so what you get when you buy a wd 5tb my passport is just the hard drive and a usb cable and nothing else, no extras for 8999 inr.however, with the seagate onetouch 5tb, for the same price, you also get a 1 year trial of mylio (a pretty cool self-hosted alternative of google photos), a 4 month trial of adobe creative cloud photography plan and 3 year rescue data recovery services. the last part is the one of the best perks of getting a seagate product. what it means is that over the 3 year warranty of your product, if your seagate hdd breaks down, you get 1 in-lab data recovery attempt by seagate for free.both wd and seagate will replace your hdd if it fails but seagate will also attempt full data recovery on the failed drive once during that 3-year warranty period which mind you, is a huge perk. data recovery services arent cheap and generally cost like 10-20 times the value of the hdd itself.now coming to performance differences between the two, im attaching all the different tests ive conducted on both hard drive using crystaldiskmark 8. theyre pretty much identical but wd has the lead over seagate for smaller file transfers while seagate does slightly better at large sequential file transfers.the wd drive was already formatted using ntfs while seagate was using exfat out of the box. after formatting the seagate hdd to ntfs, the sequential write performance decreased by around 5-10 mb/s. i hadnt encrypted the wd drive but the seagate was encrypted using the seagate toolkit (which may or may not have contributed to some performance decrease, i dont know).\\n \\n1st one was not working! got easy replacement! kudos to the seller. ultra portable, good form factor.\\n \\n2tb capacity, fast transfer speed, bought the case separatelyits my 2nd 2tb external hdd. totally worth to keep backup of personal photography files and its compact and palm sized.effective usable capacity 1.81tb.\\n \\ntheres a huge debate about which external hard disk is the best as there are many brands getting famous in india after sony stopped exporting hard disks here! sony is the best among all the other brands, no debate! but after sony i think wd is the next best, since seagate, toshiba and other brands arent good for long term, durability is most important factor according to me in hard disks ofc and i think wd is most durable among the available options!\\n \\ngot 2tb (actually 1.8 tb) at a discount for less than 5k. working okay for last 3 months. waiting to see how long this works without issue.\\n \\nthose who are seeking a perfect portable storage option go for it.\\n \\nnice to carry and have enough space\\n \\ngood 👍🏻\\n \\nspeed little bit slow.sometimes it goes very fast but some time its going too slow.so

trial of writing nearly 10gb data, explorer quickly shows (within 3seconds) all writes done, but nothing was written to disk. no idea what was wrong. this happened 3-4 times when retried. finally did 1-folder at a time and it worked.[2] this is very bad and need every time care:after safely removing drive from windows system tray, windows shows all good to disconnect, but the hdd still has led continuously flickering for 3-7 seconds or perhaps more. i had to wait for the led to completly unglow for 5+ seconds before disconnecting from usb port. the led is not bright, thus it will be difficult to notice this everytime unplug being performed.[3] warranty registration:only received email showing product serial number got registered successfully. the dates of purchase are all blank

light.getting constant 110 mbps speed.its just plug and play.got it for my studies and i am happy with the purchase.\\n \\ngood product\\n \\ngood to carrying on pocket\\n \\ni have bought hard drives from all 3 major hard drive manufacturing companies-toshiba,western digital and seagate and i have to say that my experience with western digital has been the worst out of all of them.firstly, i would talk about the performance of the drive. honestly,it is terrible! when i first bought the drive an year ago, it used to give me max 90 mb/s r/w speeds on my older laptop with usb 3.0 port(very rarely reaching 100 mb/s at times). the thing is that happened only in the initial few months of using the drive. after that the max speeds never really reached that high(only very rarely or occasionally). it now stays in the range of 30-70 mb/s(very variable speeds at times). compare that to toshiba and seagate, with toshiba i get around 80-153 mb/s read/write speeds with it usually staying in the high speed category(110mb/s+, 130mb/s average with it hitting 147 mb/s very frequently),even after filling most of the drive and using it for quite long(talking in refernce to toshiba canvio gaming, i have heard similar praises and also tried other canvio drives too and they perform the best among the competition). with seagate, i get consistent r/w speeds usually around 133 mb/s(key point being consistent). i havent tested seagate fully(also it being newer) but from initial impressions i can say that its miles beyond wd one(i have seagate expansion drive new). also point to be noted is that western digital drive performance decreases with more data being stored on it. one reason for such major performance impact maybe its hardware encryption, as quite some users have pointed out on the internet that hard drive encryption can slow down speeds(with wd drive having hardware encryption by default).secondly,the drive heats up a lot even when its idle. after an year of using it, when copying files from wd to other drive it many a times sits at around 80% active time(meaning the drive is not working to its full capacity). idle temps on the drive hover above the 42c mark(noticed it after an year of using it) which is quite hot to touch. while in operation it easily crosses 50c(i could only cool it by keeping it above a cooling pad). one thing however is that seagate drives also get hot but they do so slowly and quickly dial back in temp when they are not on load, which doesnt happen with wd(temp stays high for a very long time). thermal insulation on wd drive is also very bad, you can feel the heat directly by touching the drive(no insulation) and the bottom part being the hottest. with seagate(expansion drive) you can feel the heat only on a small part on the bottom in the new design. with toshiba gaming drive the top part is completely heat isolated and only the bottom part gets hot(which can sometimes be misleading but toshiba does the job well). the toshiba drives also remain a lot cooler than both seagate and wd drives and also dissipate heat a lot faster.thirdly,wd my passport drives are very prone to fragmentation and it is ridiculously hard to defragment at times. i could only get defraggler to get to defrag the drive with all other defrag programs refusing to even touch the drive. defrag times shows well over 3h for a 100gb defrag(other drives do this in minutes).update:i also checked my laptop internal wd blue drive and it also performs horribly like the external one however its performance is more consistent. in general wd drives are not very good performance wise(esp external).based on the above points my recommendation would be to buy other companys drives. only buy this one if you are not concerned about heat,poor performance etc.\\n \\ni have ordered wd passport 1tb hardrive, when it got delivered, i have opened it with lot of excitement but i could see the products box itself too old and its teared off, and obviously its used by someone and returned or something else. after seeing that i didnt even get a feel of opening the box, i felt like paying money for new and getting second hand product and i have starightaway messaged the costomer care. they have agreed for the refund (product only eligible for replacement) and they felt sorry for the issue aswell. and i have ordered another one freshly and it got delivered today and it looks so cool and new and gives good feel. and i used it aswell, its so light and fast, yet to discover more.\\n \\ni received a product yesterdayvery smalllight weighteasy

\\nthe product was just okay lot of the time it wont show in laptop and the password protection was garbage. in built software for password protection is useless it didnt even recognise device lot of the time. files transfer speed was also very low for this price rage. wd disappoints me a lot.\\n \\nspeed and design is good.\\n \\nbest company good product. i used since 2010.\\n \\nokay, first things first. if you are buying this particular model of hdd, be sure to get an alexvyan shockproof case with it. if you accidentally drop it, you will lose all of your precious data. also, despite what another person says in their review, do not enable write cacheing, unless you want to end up with an expensive brick, when you inadvertently remove this hdd from your pc without using safely remove hardware.now, on to the product itself. i first bought this hdd in august 2020. i dont know if amazon sent me a faulty product or if i was careless, but the hdd went kaput in the first month of usage. rmaing it was a breeze, but i lost all of my precious data, and data recovery prices are through the roof. as far as storage goes, you wont get better than wd. the read and write speeds arent half-bad either. but you will need to handle your hdd with the utmost caution to avoid any sort of damage or data loss. use only for storage and backup. if using as a storage device for your plex library, make sure you always keep it on a flat surface, and be sure to periodically disconnect it from your computer to avoid physical damage or reallocated sectors.as far as form factor and looks, an all-black serrated design looks very pristine, though id prefer to go for the red colour next time when going for my next wd hdd. the hdd isnt lightweight, and to make things worse is extremely slippery, very heavy and has a bad centre of gravity. hence my words about careful handling apply even further.tl;dr great hdd for the storage, average to good read/write speeds, but if you prefer something more rugged, go for seagate and do a full format from the default exfat to ntfs.edit: id also like to point out that the data security feature is mega useless. it encrypts the whole hard drive with a password, rather than certain folders, and this sometimes results in computers being unable to read the drive. better to use bitlocker, or maybe dont give your hdd to anyone, much less people who would snoop around, looking at your private files.\\n \\ni received product as same as they said in product specs..transfer rate also very good..i checked the transfer speed as local and

4k videos regularly and with the limited computer drive storage, the 2tb passport drive from western digital has become the savior. more than just the storage space and transfer speeds, its the supremely sleek design and wd software support that makes this product unique.i personally loved the red variant of all. the red - black dual color combination with matt finish just makes the whole hardrive design very minimalistic. if you are person who want to carry light and smart, this product perfectly suits it. though its named passport, its much smaller than a passport. fits easily in the

         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0the product stopped working today idk whats happened can u replace it ?\\n \\nthe moment i tried to connect the hdd, the device started huge noise as if there the internal fan of a cooler was switched on. i didnt expect the noise/sound from a hdd. i had a wd hdd which was working fine and without noise. i was surprised that the new one had this issue. the second issue was accessing the hdd. initial few times i got a popup asking to format the drive and when i tried to format i got an error message that the format failed due to an error. i started to doubt if this was really a new piece or a refurbished piece. sellers do have a habit of cheating the customers by getting rid of defective pieces first. i believe that happened today as well. overall, the hdd is working fine now though it gave me some initial trouble. there is an occasional noise from the hdd and i dont know the reason for that. im not that happy because of this experience of buying electronic product online. this definitely makes me remember before i decide to order an electronic product again.\\n \\nআমি বিগত দুই বছরে নিজস্ব ব্যবহারের জন্য wd harddisk  চারটে কিনেছি । খুব ভালো সার্ভিস । সব থকে বড় ব্যাপার হল আজ অবধি কোন ডেটা মিসিং হয়নি কিম্বা ক্রাক হয়নি । ধন্যবাদ ।\\n \\nvery good product.\\n \\neasy to handle light weight  external hard disk  and data transfer speed also very good  .\\n \\ncoping speed is ok\\n \\ni am using this product for daily cleaning of sofas, wall dusting\\n \\nthis is my 1st time purchasing an external hdd, i chose wd reading all those reviews and hearing their prompt services, anyway so i transferred almost 40gb stuffs from my laptop to this hdd and the transfer speed was around 70mbps on average and took me nearly 6 minutes, i was expecting it to touch over 100mbps mark as it has usb 3 but anyway... the product is extremely light weight and small, great for portability\\n \\nna\\n \\nedit 13rd week of 2021the looks are just fine. usually these devices come as plug and play, but this time i couldnt figure out what the issue is. my pc recognizes this device as does my previous wd hdd. but i couldnt use the new one. as seen in the image, it shows as unallocated space in the disk partition, and i cant make it to work. this is highly unusual and lets see what amazon will do for this.edit 24th week of 2021amazon amazes me as usual.. got a brand new one for my faulty drive, within the replacement window without much hassle.and abt the new drive, it sure is a cool one. yet to check the speeds and other info. with 4.54 tb space from my 5tb drive, i will update as soon as it passes the test for bad sectors.. and i would recommend doing that mandatorily for new drives.pros1 good looking, taking very small space and light in weight2 good built quality3 doesnt make much noise.cons1 very small led notification light.2 slight heating up during checking phase.on the whole, just like the marvel and dc fued, dont get confused over segate and this, because years of my experience has made it clear that wd is reliable and stays with you for years to come, given you handle it properly..just check for the bad sectors when u get it new and just plug and play..will update after further usage..\\n \\nwith usb 2.0 it gives a transfer rate of about 22 mbps. although it keeps on varying from 1 mbps to 22 mbps. with usb 3.0 port it gives a transfer rate of about 40 to 50 mbps. at one point of time ii also got a transfer rate of about 70 mbps. my laptop has usb 2.0 port so it gave about 20 mbps. at first i thought of returning it but when i used it in usb 3.0 port, it gave 40 mbps transfer rate. after searching on net, i found that every harddisk gives this much transfer rate although they mention speeds in gbps but thats all theoretical. so if you want to buy a harddisk you can go for this as its durabilty and serviceability is high as compared to other brands. also it is very small in size and hence portable.also, you will get a storage of 931 gb although it has a storage of 1 tb.\\n \\nthis is great for backups and exchange data with friends and family members but only thing is i cannot connect it with my samsung galaxy phone they should provide an additional software for connecting it to android devices\\n \\nsuper\\n \\ngetting very slow transfer speed\\n \\n1)transfer speed is 110 to 120 mb, dont expect hight rate transfer speed above one is maximum  speed i noticed while transfering data from laptop to hard disk.2) design is too good.3) really slim and fit into pocket also.4) compatiability is nice.5) packaging is tight and crisp.6) deliver time packaging was good from amazon.7) data security also given in the hard disk.8) i purchased in ₹4444 2tb hard disk.you can got for it if you want a pocket friendly and fit in to your budget.\\n \\nvalue for money\\n \\ngood प्राइस sleem product\\n \\nvery handy and light weight. been a month. nothing more to say.\\n \\ndata storage\\n \\nplease dont buy this it stopped working and the seller does not respond even in warranty period.update amazon helped me get in touch and i got a new  replacement hard disk which works fine.\\n \\nit was delivered within 24 hours. the size of the hd and the speeds of data transfer are awesome. i was initially looking for 1-2 tb but the price of the hd attracted me to go for 5tb.the actual capacity is 4.5 tb.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0the purpose of wd 4tb  my passport is to be a backup drive of your data. it is well designed for the purpose. i have had many wd products in the past and they have been very reliable. i want to share some great features about this product1. storage capacity i have bought wd 4tb my passport portable external hard drive, blue - with automatic backup, 256bit aes hardware encryption & software protection2. transfer speedthe wd my passport 4tb comes with a portable hard drive and a high speed usb 3.0 connector. the portable storage comes with a 3 year warrantyi had no problem transferring both large files taking several minutes and many many smaller files in large batches back and forth between pc and drive.3. portability and durabilityits small size and light weight make it great for traveling and being able to grab and go and it wont take up much desk space. i highly recommend the my passport.there’s also an option to save backups to a cloud service such a dropbox so you don’t have to worry about bringing the drive with you everywhere.4. securitythe drive comes with wd discovery for either windows and mac. you can set up the hardware encryption with this app. with the encryption software, you can set a password so that whenever you access the hard drive you have to enter the password. you can protect your private data. you can set up scheduled backups through the app. you cannot schedule it through windows if you have hard drive encryption enabled5. compatibilitypreloaded on the drive is a pair of install wrappers for western digital’s discovery dashboard – one for windows and one for mac. running them should, ideally, download the latest version of the utility from the internet and install it on your machine (go to western digital’s support website and download it from there before it would actually work.) this then lets you install 3 basic apps: one for backups, another for security management, and one for maintenance and health monitoring of the drive.6. gamingusb 3.0 is quite important here as the speed can affect its waiting time and game responsiveness. this drive comes with usb 3.0 that matches the speed of ssd also it matches ps4 colours.only con is there is no usb type c.overall, if you need an affordable portable drive as storage expansion or for backing up your computer, you will find my passport 4tb is an easy and safe choice.\\n \\nbeen using it for a couple of months now, no issues so far. i also edit photos from it, speed is good enough for that.\\n \\ngood...\\n \\nstorage capacity is good but not working properly\\n \\njust check for the bad sectors after purchasing and i think the write speed is low\\n \\nnot responding with laptops its damage pic and your agency tack back product and not replaced new one or not refund payment please solve problem\\n \\namazon asked me what i liked or disliked while writing the review.dislike: my first order for this product (seller appario) was a fake one. when i held the hard disk it felt lightweight, on connecting it to two laptops on different ports the light would switch on however the disk drive would never show. the hard disk didnt vibrate (rotating disks were not felt). the disk management of windows didnt detect it too. it simply showed up in task bar as my passport 6267. upon checking usb drivers it showed code 43: set address failed. seems a pretty famous error if you look it up on google. checked the s/n on wd site and it showed warranty till 2024. strange. tried to update drivers, but no success. finally put it in replacement.like: same seller this time sent original product. got 3.63 tb usable out of 4 tb. write speeds are ~117 mb/s (copying from hdd to laptop or reverse, both same). hard disk is really portable and i liked the colour options. bought a case for it as well (separate positive review on that too.)thank you.\\n \\none of the best options available in the market. portable, lightweight, cross-device compatible and value for money.test with my realme gt master edition (android phone) over otg. working fine.transfer speed is upto 80-100mbps on 7200rpm hdd with amd ryzen 7 5600h (windows 11)\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0amazing product with good quality and looks awesome\\n \\ni am using this drive for past one year and it served me well.i have been using it to carry my data as carrying my gaming laptop to my collage is quite hard.the drive is quite reliable when it comes to speed. the speed is good.it offer some great security for the price as it offers hardware based security at this price point.if you are looking for a slim, reliable and secure hdd then you cant go wrong with this one.its a open recommendation from me just go for it.\\n \\nthe drives look very nice, and are half as thick as my old wd drives with the same capacity. transfer speed is about the same. but these drives are noisy! i have two of them. and i havent had such noise drives since the 90s when i could hear my disk drive. i just use them for backups so i dont care, but its a surprise that considering older wd drives dont make so much noise, these do. i doubt i received a defective one, because i have two drives, and both are noisy. this is just the way they are.\\n \\nyes its light weighted.its too small in size u can carry in palm easly.\\n \\nnice product\\n \\ngreat deal at its price\\n \\nportable and the right size\\n \\nnice, less noisy , good speed\\n \\ncolour is white and somewhat little storage due to internal aap installation.\\n \\nvery comprehensive lightweight nice product\\n \\nits much better than i expected.slim and light weight. data transfer speed is good. boots fast.design is also fine.cable is quite short.but couldnt install wd software. tried 4 to 5 times, still it didnt.\\n \\nliked it\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\nvery compact product from trusted brand. quality product\\n \\nit is handy and has good storage capacity. copy speed is okay, will recommend this product to everyone.\\n \\nwell, its good but you should go for one with type cit can easily give speed of 120mbps write speedsome will find problem like writing speed is 25mbps but there is a solution for that...some people may find problem with connectivity that its not showing in your pc or something like that but its not a huge problem at all you just do one thing go on youtube and search your problem will be solved...its compact and lightweight in this segmentim not talking about ssdssds are very light than hddbut in hdd segment its comparatively light\\n \\nit is better... lightweight... portable...nice design... storage is about 1.8t....transfer speed is quite good... quality is good...comes with password protection... backup and some more features...overall satisfied with the product.\\n \\nwd is best to choose among other brands its not like other brands are bad but considering every aspect of wd that includes service,product quality,longivity etc wd is best and wd failure rate is lower compare to seagate and other brands actually quality defers from region to region guys and for those who are complaining about disk not working etc etc plz dont try to plug and unplug the cable to hdd more no of times cuz the brands are made them worst by manufacturing the inside drive as a soldered to motherboard and its not good when u plug and unplug many times roughly then the solder will loose its grip and may break from motherboard so use it delicately and we request the ext hdd manufacturers to bring back the old sata type connection not this crappy soldered models... and the reading speed writing speed are as usual 120-140mbps in usb 3.0 & 3.1 interface ... thank u wd and amazons intime delivery and package is awesome.\\n \\ngood product nice\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\nread write speed are almost same 120 mbps... though some vedios shows 4-5 gbps transfer rate from hard disk to pc but i never got that speed  even though i have a  thunder bolt port and usb 3.2 gen 1 port.. in both speed are the same good for average speed transfer\\n \\nit is not supporting ps4.\\n \\ngood\\n \\nwhen i recieved it i was happy i had earlie purcahe red one which spins a lots even afater safely remove this one not seems.i tested it usign hdd regenration and then hdd tune pro again 5 time i tested for surface test usign hdd sentinel scanning took in usb 3 only 4 hours 20 mins and scannign in hdd regenratio 5 hours 20 min that insane  in usb 3 i means else it ould hav kten 2 days in usb 2.0 .and transfer speed i means i copied my old wd 4tb files to this  i put in usb 2 that old wd 4tb and tranfer somver 800 gb and the speed was averatge 37mb/sec .this hardisk was attachd in usb 3 .normally the speed might reach 200 mb /sec if connected both in usb 3 or even more as scannign speed during surface test and otehr test shows that speed 240 mb/sec.hpe it lasts more than5 yeas as i had one wd drive interal still over 1750 days runtime stil no errors another wd i purcahsed in sep 2014 1 tb wd passport ultra from amazon used occasional still no badsector .wd are reliable .just need to be carefully if so many chuk files like photos and all corrupts the mft table as large amount of files they are i mean photos and all small files .if large fiels i had less no of file count ..the mft get corrupted.use paragon hardisk manager to compact mft .and it works again.still never believe a hardisk it can fail any time alwasys keep backup copy 3-2-1 rule .keep mft record of that hardisk using wiztree software (mft dump ) you can use to analyse if hardisk get corrputed or data recovery time .\\n \\ngood storage capacity\\n \\nit has enough space for my movies and game storage. it has great speed and .the design is simple and super. i really loved the product .\\n \\nnothing\\n \\nits so small just fight to pocket data transfer is speed as compared to my old sony. till now its performance is nice. perfect for daily use and travelling perpose\\n \\nbest external hdd with enough capacity to store. more importantly, oraganized files rather than junk. else, youll keep crying for more storage even after having 4tb of storage space.\\n \\nwent for this passport hd storage due to wds reputation, even though my experience with an earlier wd elements drive was not that great.issues with passport drive:1. wd discovery did not install initially. i tried on 2 separate computers running win 10. it would install till 18% and then not proceed. this is a known issue if you search on the net. surprising that wd hasnt fixed it yet.2. following the workarounds managed to install wd discovery. next the wd backup app didnt install. this too had to be worked around before was finally able to install it.3. transferring files took ages. got error messages for several files (documents, images etc), which didnt get copied.4. the transferred files and folders on the drive did not display when i attached the drive to my other computer. that was the main reason i got the drive, to be able to have the files in one place to use on several computers!conclusion: installing, running and transferring files was very time consuming and frustrating.  its better to install other software for backup/transferring files. much faster and more reliable.am unlikely to go with any wd products again.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n \\ngood\\n \\ndrive got corrupted even though i was careful with the usage. fortunately, i got it replaced.\\n \\ni love this hard disk its quite compact and easy to use. i have kept my data on this disk have not got any issues regarding data corruption or any other issues so far. it also have a feature to encrypt the disk with password which tightens the data security.\\n \\nwriting review for a replacement drive after the first one failed very shortly within a day of using it. suddenly after a while the drive started to make loud fan-like noise with lots of clicking sounds(the drive head trying to copy/fetch data) and finally after sometime i heard the click of death (google it if you want to know more) and the drive stopped getting recognized by windows and the os stopped responding whenever this drive was plugged in. i googled and got to know that it happens when there are bad sectors detected or mechanical failure inside. luckily after sometime i was able to copy back the data from the drive to my local existing internal hdd drive and immediately asked for replacement. thanks a lot to amazon for getting it quickly replaced by a new drive.i used a software recommend by western digital to check the health of the drive - data lifeguard diagnostic for windows. great software to check for problems with any hdd.works fine when there are no mechanical problems inside and is light weight and portable too. have to be a little more careful while handling it because of its size.\\n \\ncontains much more space that i could save my whole laptop data at once!!! must have…\\n \\ni got a storage capacity of 1.8gb that’s a bit low on the product and the security software is not concluded have to download it separately again overall the product is fine slim and elegant\\n \\nwas in a dilemma whether to buy wd or seagate - they are both equally reputable in this space. post analysis settled for this version of the my passport has it seemed like it was good in terms of value for money. in terms of the seller, no issues.however, wd passport ( and im assuming all the other external hard disks) have some serious compatible issues with mac. in my case, i was on a high serrier version os and my passport was not being detected by mac. after alot of research across wd website, forums, blogs etc - i figured out that its a very common issue with alot of folks worldwide. in the end, i had to upgrade to the latest os ( big sur), download wd utilities and post some messing around, it magically got detected.once, its detected there are no issues and works great !\\n \\nno words than the bestest drive in the market. i have already used all other brandsbut its the best ever\\n \\noverall it was good. no problem in product. perfectly fine but the cover in which it was sent was broken. i did not complain as product was ok.\\n \\nthe wd is best for making storage hard drives.pros:1. i got product on time and started using it from same day. till now no issues.2.100mbps+ read speed with usb 3.0 only.3. write speed is little slow(max 30mbps).cons:1. the only drawback is, it give you 4500gb space instead of 5120gb and as you know 10% of drive need to be empty to get better performance. that means 450gb is useless and you actually get 4tb for proper usage while you paid for 5tb space.2. the wd have a contest to fool you (at least by this seller). the same hdd is on amazon without that scratch coupon , it have free hdd portable cover worth of rs.1000.3. also that wd software which comes inside hdd is useless, as in regular usage you dont need such softwares. i agree in initial days of usage you might face some hdd detection issues, but that are just usb driver specific only.(you need to update usb drivers if needed)conclusion: dont get fool for laptop and go with hdd which have free cover and also try to research on which hdd give you more space (i.e wd4tb,2tb,1tb or any other brand with good storage) and go with it no matter which brand .\\n \\nvery thin, portable, good looking drive\\n \\ni have been using various hard disks since many years. this one is by far the smallest, fastest and highest capacity drive of my lot. fully recommended.\\n \\n1-dec-2020,i received wd 5 tb black my passport hdd.on 13-dec-2020,i made backup of my previous hdd content,on 16-dec-2020,when i plugged in my new wd 5 tb black my passport hdd i found all my data to be un-reading/un-accessable/ basically a unformated drive pop up appeared. that means all my data ... you know what i meant.the amazon return window was closed and all my backup data was lost.did some troubleshooting and discovered,hdd retains information till the time its connected to laptop,once hdd is ejected (using wd discovery software), & , reconnected back, boom, all data gone.i called up wd, told them everything, performed troubleshooting steps on call and rma number was generated.i went to the wd center, gave them my faulty hdd and,on 2-jan-2021,received a new wd 5 tb my passport.tip: please use wd drive utilities and format your hdd - twice, even if the data is un-accessable, the reason being there is bits & bytes of data on hdd, so formating your hdd will give some peace of mind. remember- format (dont do quick format.)wd service was appreciated a lot, even though red color hdd was bit querky !!by the way: please check wd official website for accurate toll free number.\\n \\ngood one i am very happy\\n \\nproduct is handy, fast & easy to connect\\n \\nnice but its very costly\\n \\nnice product and worth to money\\n \\nnice one light weight\\n \\nwd security software is not working, els good!\\n \\nnice product! using for storing educational videos for my son. very good customer support from wd. hope it performs well and lasts long☺\\n \\nuseful for storing documents and light weight to carry it around.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    the media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0making a very weird sound periodically..quite like a leaking tap..the disc itself came well-packed and seal was intact but the sound is an issue..bought 5 hard drives before this from local electronics store,none had such issues..wd itself is a very good brand in terms of reliability and performance,i have 2 more from the same brand,but the first time i am having this issue..when the amazon delivery guy handed me this item he fished it out from the bottom of the rucksack(he dropped the rucksack to the floor from above 2.5 feet before fishing the hdd out)..these items are malhandled by these delivery guys without any sensitivity to the nature of the content,that is why broken coffee mugs,books with the spine and corners broken et cetera are the most returned items on amazon..good seller,handling of delivery of sensitive equipments by amazon delivery guy is below par although..should not blame the seller for that..none of the electronic goods i bought from appario retail ever gave me trouble but the hdd i have bought this time is making a weird sound every 3 seconds like a hiccup..the delivery people dont have any sensitivity when it comes to handling delicate items(except for mobile phones maybe)..for other electronics items they adopt a go-to-hell-for-all-i-care attitude..1-these items should not be placed at the bottom of the heap(they did in this case)2-these items should not be subjected to dropping from a height(while getting it out of the heavy rucksack packed to the brim the delivery guy dropped the rucksack from waist level to the floor,about 2.5 feet drop..add to that the weight of other irems on top of it and do the math)i have already asked for a replacement for this item..waiting to see how that works26th november,update:the replacement is working fine.\\n \\nlightweight,

       "'the media could not be loaded  ☝️a preview to purchase                                     i like to keep backups of backups of my lifetime collected data  thus have over 15 tb of external harddisks in my arsenal with a dominant share of western digital disks  both passport  elements   few others like transcend  samsung ssd  a seagate  old usb 20  🔶️ now  whenever we opt to go for a new external disk purchase  the following challenges are encountered  if you are planning to invest thousands in purchase  my detailed review  even though a bit lengthy is worth reading👉 hdds vs ssds                        while none of the mechanical hdds can reach the blazing fast speeds of ssds in excess of 500 mb/s r/w  the hdds definitely offer a better value for money per mb of storagealso if data is corrupted in a ssd its almost never retrievable while in a hdd  there is always a hope depending upon extent of damage🔷️ so for majority bulk backup  hdd are a better option to costlier ssds👉 wd vs seagate                       this is again a topmost struggle making a decision🔸️now both are giant reputed american storage brands  preference is mostly based upon personal usage experiences🔸️i read somewhere that seagate offers better speeds  wd better reliability but i dont feel its true as speeds depend upon type of files being transferred  reliability upon manufacturing processes  which is hard to doubt for both brands🔸️ regarding price wd is a bit costlier to seagate for same capacity🔸️ both offer same warranties of 3 yearsi had a wd failure  my friend had seagate failure  yet we both got replacements with data restored from their service centres🔸️ regarding inbuilt software  i suppose wd is better as it comes with wd discovery that can link with all your social portals for backup too🔷️ so you can go for any of these brands  wd being my personal favourite🔷️ to ensure failsafe operation  testing for bad sectors before use  using wd utility or any other hdd inspection software like hd sentinel etc  is always a good idea🔷️ store these drives horizontally in a dry case  not vertically or inclined  as in latter case the heads and platters tend to deform  get stucki learnt it the hard way💝 i bought the latest 2019 4 tb passport drive and 363 tb of usable space was available in it🔸️ the packing as usual was good enough with an instruction manual  8 inches of connecting cable5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd enclosure is premium abs plastic which can surely withstand few non severe slips  fallsa periphery cushioning or base padding with shock absorbent rubber would additionaly be great42 /5 ⭐🔸️ the design  looks of this new drive arent as elegant  classy  as previous passports  elements as my personal opinion2/5 ⭐🔸️ the drive is very compact  sturdy  light weight too5/5 ⭐🔸️ it was formatted in ntfs mode with 4096 bytes of allocation unit sizeexfat is another option  you can play with allocation size also for better speeds but a bit less space5/5 ⭐🔸️ with a mixed media  software file folder transfer of 5 gb  i registered  a write speed of 112 mb /s  a read speed of 160 mb /s on my hp omen core i7 configuration  which i suppose is fair enough for a mechanical hard drive5/5 ⭐🔸️ the new hard disk has softwares for mac  windows backup both5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd has a very small point like white led indication for status  wont bother much in dark rooms5/5 ⭐🔸️ the hd is very silent during operation  doesnt heat much even after few hours of backup5/5 ⭐🔸️ warranty offered is 3 years which is contemporary to industry standards  similar to seagateas already quoted earlier  i had one harddisk replaced  data restored in warranty like 6 years back by wdso no issues there  noone is going to offer pick  drop at home  be assured🤏 final verdict                        all in all  i have always been a wd guy  this new 2019 version further restores my faith in the same  wasnt able to transfer data from windows service pack 3 which was my main motive but over all product is very good  very light weight  transfer rate depends upon system youre using but generally between 3060 mbps and in latest laptops  45 years old  speed is around 80 mbps  good performance good product  although would like to see how long it works without issue  hope the sellers are open to assist with warranty issues if needed  this ssd is cheaper than 1tb ssd as price comparison  worth buying  after 1 month it did not starting how can i claim this product warranty the media could not be loaded  i create youtube videos for my wifes cooking channel and storage has been a big want for us  i have a wd mycloud 2tb with a seagate 4tb backup plus as a backup and both required power  but i need a 4tb portable hard disk and ended up in buying this western digital 4tb my passport portable hard disk  new edition  for rs8198                         📦 in the box  hdd contents                         ◾ 4tb blue portable harddisk in a bubble case◾ superspeed usb cable◾ quick install guide◾ wd discovery software for wd backup◾ wd security and wd drive utilities                     🗓️ my usage  experience                     the product has been manufactured in thailand and imported to india and this new edition wd my passport is supposed to have lesser failures and supposed to be more robust than the previous versionupon connecting 363tb was free and 297mb was used by the formatting of the disk which stores the disk geometry that allows hard disk to accept  store  and retrieve data  the hard disk was formatted with ntfsthis hard disk fits inside the palm of the hand and is quite small for a 4tb  107cm length  75cm breadth and 18cm depth  and is not heavy toobeing a portable hard disk  it doesn  t require any power  i was able to connect it with my xbox  wd mycloud  laptop and desktop with ease and it detects quite fastthe write speeds were at 110 mb/s in actual and read speeds was around 115 mb/s  the disk reports were also almost similar at 120127 mb/s   see attached report   but the speeds changes depending on the free disk space  how much the disk is fragmented and whether there are any bad sectors  etc  this is quite impressive in my opinioni didnt see any heating up issues with this new edition and temperature always remained under 37 degree c even under heavy writes in my testing with room temperature around 27 degree cthe wd discovery software is super cool  it can import files from social media and maintain a backup  just need to sign into facebook or instagram or dropbox  google drive or onedrive  it can also take a backup from wd mycloud devicesthe wd security app provides a way to setup a password for the hard disk and contents can be encrypted  so when data is written its encrypted and when data is read its decrypted when password is used  i havent tried any brute force recovery of data on this disk yet but the encryption seems to be good enough for home use  i didnt set the password as if password is forgotten i cant recover it back and only way to reuse the disk is by formattingthe hard disk has a small led indicator which can be turned off from the wd discovery settings if requiredi was able to backup all my youtube video edits with ease and quickly  also was able to back up my dropboxi dont see any cons as of now  and since i havent contacted the customer service i cant comment on that part             💖 what i liked             ◾ 3 years warranty◾ good looking and light weight◾ automatic backup  password protection + 256bit encryption◾ fast read and write speeds          🥇 overall          a great hard disk at a good pricing  this new edition should be more stable and when take care well like not moving the hard disk while it being used  doing a safe eject of the hard disk  not dropping etc  this hard disk should last longer in my perspective  only time will tell  overall am happy with my purchase as it meets my expectations  very beneficial this is a very very early review  will definitely update after 6 days  if anything happens and then will try to update subsequently  now  coming to delivery  i am very pleased as it just arrive in one day  packaging wise  it was good  both outside and main packaging  after i inserted the hdd  i got around 931 gb of free space  i download the apps and set my password  but could not register the product from the app  the speed initially  as can be seen from above photo  seems really good but lets see for how long it can maintain that speed  but  it has some sound inside  not annoying but upon bringing little closer to ear  you can hear it  dont know its normal or not  so have to check it properly  rest  so far so good  but its really damn light and very small  pruchased it for one of my friend as i am from it filed and he asked me to do it for him  i have used wd portable and wd desktop drives for my personal use so i recommended this for him  very nice harddisk 😊 didnt get any big discount for the independence day week purchase  but got it at 54k which is very less than what the local sellers quote  the size of this hard disk is very small and one can easily fit it into the front shirt pocket if they wanted to  it is very lightweight so you wont notice any issues while carrying it during travelsstorage is 2tb but 181tb is what can be usedi have used it for 2 days now and i am getting around 112 to 130mb/s speed transfer using usb 30i chose the color blue  but one side is still black while the front side is blackthere is one cable provided for you to connect this to your pc but it is very small and because of that you need to keep it next to your portwd provides 3 years warranty  you will be able to get a replacement for your broken hard drive if it stopped working for 3 years total  you need to register for it on their website  i dont think physical damage is considered under this limited warrantyif it breaks  youll lose your data  the replacement under warranty does not consider any data loss youll haveoverall  i am happy with my purchase  i wish i couldve gotten more discount though  good product good product value for money before you pull out your pitchforks  im a big wd fan  i have been using their products for years and have yet to have a single hard drive failure  even my oldest powered 2tb wd my book drive from 2013 is still alive and kicking today  that being said  seagate products have learnt from their early mistakes and their hard drive are now more or less just as reliable as wd products  google  backblaze hard drive stats  however since wd have enjoyed their spot at the top  they dont feel like they need to provide anything more than the bare minimum so what you get when you buy a wd 5tb my passport is just the hard drive and a usb cable and nothing else  no extras for 8999 inrhowever  with the seagate onetouch 5tb  for the same price  you also get a 1 year trial of mylio  a pretty cool selfhosted alternative of google photos   a 4 month trial of adobe creative cloud photography plan and 3 year rescue data recovery services  the last part is the one of the best perks of getting a seagate product  what it means is that over the 3 year warranty of your product  if your seagate hdd breaks down  you get 1 inlab data recovery attempt by seagate for freeboth wd and seagate will replace your hdd if it fails but seagate will also attempt full data recovery on the failed drive once during that 3year warranty period which mind you  is a huge perk  data recovery services arent cheap and generally cost like 1020 times the value of the hdd itselfnow coming to performance differences between the two  im attaching all the different tests ive conducted on both hard drive using crystaldiskmark 8 theyre pretty much identical but wd has the lead over seagate for smaller file transfers while seagate does slightly better at large sequential file transfersthe wd drive was already formatted using ntfs while seagate was using exfat out of the box  after formatting the seagate hdd to ntfs  the sequential write performance decreased by around 510 mb/s  i hadnt encrypted the wd drive but the seagate was encrypted using the seagate toolkit  which may or may not have contributed to some performance decrease  i dont know   1st one was not working  got easy replacement  kudos to the seller  ultra portable  good form factor  2tb capacity  fast transfer speed  bought the case separatelyits my 2nd 2tb external hdd  totally worth to keep backup of personal photography files and its compact and palm sizedeffective usable capacity 181tb  theres a huge debate about which external hard disk is the best as there are many brands getting famous in india after sony stopped exporting hard disks here  sony is the best among all the other brands  no debate  but after sony i think wd is the next best  since seagate  toshiba and other brands arent good for long term  durability is most important factor according to me in hard disks ofc and i think wd is most durable among the available options  got 2tb  actually 18 tb  at a discount for less than 5k  working okay for last 3 months  waiting to see how long this works without issue  those who are seeking a perfect portable storage option go for it  nice to carry and have enough space good 👍🏻 speed little bit slowsometimes it goes very fast but some time its going too slowso its not give constant speedso my suggestins is dont buy external harddrive  go for external ssd so you can get more speed at constant rate  nice product  value for money sorry by mistake i have given wrong review for this item is okay as per my requirement light weight  responsive  nice authentic very compact and nice product  paching was also good  but little low on transfer speed then expected  and also the cable is loose or the port on hard disk is damaged it gets disconnected on little movements  working great after using for a few monthsi use crystaldiskinfo to monitor drive health and no issues so far  good worthy  highly not recommended  1 facing so many issues in this2  now and then entire hard disk shows like like empty hard disk3  connecting take ages  its not full loaded got 4tb left still me facing this issue4  even while working on files in premier pro  phoptoshop suddenly it will say file not accessible very good while sleek and compact  it also looks rugged  bought a carry case anyways as a precaution very light and compact the media could not be loaded  better than its previous versionsbetter storgae capacitygood transfer speed was able to register product online on the wd site  wd tools make setting up the password and backup effortless  good speed too  its really worth it  wd external disk is very good for storage and easy to carry  but speed of data transfer is a bit slow compared to seagate  storage works perfectly  and durable good looking  light weight nice prodect i love it the best product and compatibility  its just installed and very easy to use 100mbps its affordable and does the job well  performance is okayokay        sequential write of 5gb iso file was 110 to 120mb/ssequential write of 4k quality photos  2gb  was poor 30 to 50mb/swas expecting a lot better  using windows 10 proissues faced so far               [ 1 ] windows explorer miscellaneously failed  upon first poweron and trial of writing nearly 10gb data  explorer quickly shows  within 3seconds  all writes done  but nothing was written to disk  no idea what was wrong  this happened 34 times when retried  finally did 1folder at a time and it worked  [ 2 ] this is very bad and need every time care  after safely removing drive from windows system tray  windows shows all good to disconnect  but the hdd still has led continuously flickering for 37 seconds or perhaps more  i had to wait for the led to completly unglow for 5+ seconds before disconnecting from usb port  the led is not bright  thus it will be difficult to notice this everytime unplug being performed  [ 3 ] warranty registration  only received email showing product serial number got registered successfully  the dates of purchase are all blank in the email received  the serial number on invoice from appario seller is different from whats on the hdd  got in prime day offer for 8k  5tb with no cost emi  very quick delivery within 1 dayno need to worry about storage now  total 454 tb available to use in 5tb  also with good speed of 100 mb /secwill update my review based on long term usage  product is awesome and lightweight good product with a fast read/write speed of 100/mbps god building quality and portable

transfer speed also good  good  meets the requirements really needed this one for backup storage the media could not be loaded  the hard disk is very compact and lightgetting constant 110 mbps speedits just plug and playgot it for my studies and i am happy with the purchase  good product good to carrying on pocket i have bought hard drives from all 3 major hard drive manufacturing companiestoshiba  western digital and seagate and i have to say that my experience with western digital has been the worst out of all of themfirstly  i would talk about the performance of the drive  honestly  it is terrible  when i first bought the drive an year ago  it used to give me max 90 mb/s r/w speeds on my older laptop with usb 30 port  very rarely reaching 100 mb/s at times   the thing is that happened only in the initial few months of using the drive  after that the max speeds never really reached that high  only very rarely or occasionally   it now stays in the range of 3070 mb/s  very variable speeds at times   compare that to toshiba and seagate  with toshiba i get around 80153 mb/s read/write speeds with it usually staying in the high speed category  110mb/s+  130mb/s average with it hitting 147 mb/s very frequently   even after filling most of the drive and using it for quite long  talking in refernce to toshiba canvio gaming  i have heard similar praises and also tried other canvio drives too and they perform the best among the competition   with seagate  i get consistent r/w speeds usually around 133 mb/s  key point being consistent   i havent tested seagate fully  also it being newer  but from initial impressions i can say that its miles beyond wd one  i have seagate expansion drive new   also point to be noted is that western digital drive performance decreases with more data being stored on it  one reason for such major performance impact maybe its hardware encryption  as quite some users have pointed out on the internet that hard drive encryption can slow down speeds  with wd drive having hardware encryption by default  secondly  the drive heats up a lot even when its idle  after an year of using it  when copying files from wd to other drive it many a times sits at around 80  active time  meaning the drive is not working to its full capacity   idle temps on the drive hover above the 42c mark  noticed it after an year of using it  which is quite hot to touch  while in operation it easily crosses 50c  i could only cool it by keeping it above a cooling pad   one thing however is that seagate drives also get hot but they do so slowly and quickly dial back in temp when they are not on load  which doesnt happen with wd  temp stays high for a very long time   thermal insulation on wd drive is also very bad  you can feel the heat directly by touching the drive  no insulation  and the bottom part being the hottest  with seagate  expansion drive  you can feel the heat only on a small part on the bottom in the new design  with toshiba gaming drive the top part is completely heat isolated and only the bottom part gets hot  which can sometimes be misleading but toshiba does the job well   the toshiba drives also remain a lot cooler than both seagate and wd drives and also dissipate heat a lot fasterthirdly  wd my passport drives are very prone to fragmentation and it is ridiculously hard to defragment at times  i could only get defraggler to get to defrag the drive with all other defrag programs refusing to even touch the drive  defrag times shows well over 3h for a 100gb defrag  other drives do this in minutes  update  i also checked my laptop internal wd blue drive and it also performs horribly like the external one however its performance is more consistent  in general wd drives are not very good performance wise  esp external  based on the above points my recommendation would be to buy other companys drives  only buy this one if you are not concerned about heat  poor performance etc  i have ordered wd passport 1tb hardrive  when it got delivered  i have opened it with lot of excitement but i could see the products box itself too old and its teared off  and obviously its used by someone and returned or something else  after seeing that i didnt even get a feel of opening the box  i felt like paying money for new and getting second hand product and i have starightaway messaged the costomer care  they have agreed for the refund  product only eligible for replacement  and they felt sorry for the issue aswell  and i have ordered another one freshly and it got delivered today and it looks so cool and new and gives good feel  and i used it aswell  its so light and fast  yet to discover more  i received a product yesterdayvery smalllight weighteasy to carry2tb wd my passporttransfer speed 115 mb/s

partnerplease use bubbles cover on product for safety purposei received ah product package in pressed condition ver very good good product the product was just okay lot of the time it wont show in laptop and the password protection was garbage  in built software for password protection is useless it didnt even recognise device lot of the time  files transfer speed was also very low for this price rage  wd disappoints me a lot  speed and design is good  best company good product  i used since 2010 okay  first things first  if you are buying this particular model of hdd  be sure to get an alexvyan shockproof case with it  if you accidentally drop it  you will lose all of your precious data  also  despite what another person says in their review  do not enable write cacheing  unless you want to end up with an expensive brick  when you inadvertently remove this hdd from your pc without using safely remove hardwarenow  on to the product itself  i first bought this hdd in august 2020 i dont know if amazon sent me a faulty product or if i was careless  but the hdd went kaput in the first month of usage  rmaing it was a breeze  but i lost all of my precious data  and data recovery prices are through the roof  as far as storage goes  you wont get better than wd  the read and write speeds arent halfbad either  but you will need to handle your hdd with the utmost caution to avoid any sort of damage or data loss  use only for storage and backup  if using as a storage device for your plex library  make sure you always keep it on a flat surface  and be sure to periodically disconnect it from your computer to avoid physical damage or reallocated sectorsas far as form factor and looks  an allblack serrated design looks very pristine  though id prefer to go for the red colour next time when going for my next wd hdd  the hdd isnt lightweight  and to make things worse is extremely slippery  very heavy and has a bad centre of gravity  hence my words about careful handling apply even furthertl  dr great hdd for the storage  average to good read/write speeds  but if you prefer something more rugged  go for seagate and do a full format from the default exfat to ntfsedit  id also like to point out that the data security feature is mega useless  it encrypts the whole hard drive with a password  rather than certain folders  and this sometimes results in computers being unable to read the drive  better to use bitlocker  or maybe dont give your hdd to anyone  much less people who would snoop around  looking at your private files  i received product as same as they said in product specs  transfer rate also very good  i checked the transfer speed as local and network alsoboth are satisfiedconnectivity also good  18 tb storage getlight weight and slim great product  registered online  good price  thank you amazon and seller best value for your money it stopped working on the first use… worst choice i have made by choosing wd good transfer speeds but software is little old for backup  very very compact and small as thin as a mobile  go for it  awesome product by western digital 👌 👍🏻 the media could not be loaded  very slow speed but i don know why😔 i used usb 30 port for transfer data  passport disspointed verymuch the media could not be loaded  i keep taking a lot of 4k videos regularly and with the limited computer drive storage  the 2tb passport drive from western digital has become the savior  more than just the storage space and transfer speeds  its the supremely sleek design and wd software support that makes this product uniquei personally loved the red variant of all  the red  black dual color combination with matt finish just makes the whole hardrive design very minimalistic  if you are person who want to carry light and smart  this product perfectly suits it  though its named passport  its much smaller than a passport  fits easily in the palm and does slip out easily            ⏩⏩ box contents             1 western

smooth  nice  product is good its looking nice  its comapct handy and fairly quick  real easy to use  the product has some minor scratches on the body a small little that is only the drawback i experienced very light and a large storage  i used for 1year for a very little duration  recently i started using a little bit more for my sisters marriage pics and videos 400gb i stored and when i thought of copying it into laptop the hard disc was not detecting by any system  i took it to the computer service centre they diagonise and said the media driver was gone for a toss  now all my data was gone within few days  now am not sure even the data recovery centre can retrieve the data  so be careful guys wd quality is good and performance is as per expectations so far   3months of usage  when received  i tested for some 90gb transfer of files  seems to be functioning excellent  will try another transfer of files and let you know later  if any malfunctions or any other  otherwise it will be good  received as expected smaller than iphone 12 but with 5tb capacity  no external power source  a wonderful piece of tech with only 8k price  using it 6months now  read write speed more than 100 mbps  very well recommended  its been a wonderful device since the time ive first purchased it couple of years ago  the storage you get is around 363 tb and due to my heavy usage its already coming to its full capacity lol  overall  i dont have much complaints not have faced any issues till now  nice product the build quality is good especially the new and compact design like before the wd hard drive used to be a heavy and thick one but this one is really slim easy to carry light weightcopy speed is up to   110120mbps which is good 👍 i have only used up to half the full drive capacity and the read write performance still feels good as new without any signs of slowing  i deliberately chose a larger drive than my intended usage capacity as these drives tend to slow down as they get full  its still working superb  and data transfer speed is good  light weight  totally fine product  great after all its a hard disk  nothing so special  yeah it does the work perfectly  no worries  very fast and handy gorgeous light weight light weight  colour  storage capacity nice wd is good brand harddisk     181 tb of usable storage for 2tb hard drive i could see copying speeds up to 118mb/s the hard drive is really compact and lightweight  i wasnt expecting it to be this compact loved the build quality and the textured finish of the product absolutely no issue at connecting to various devices the chord is relatively short  but does the job pretty wellrest all is pretty standard  and as described in the about section of the productan easy recommendation for anyone who is looking to buy a hard drive  it is about my experiencelight weight  easy portability  and i space is as mentionedpros  i am unable to register best for this price very good product the software on the hdd wont install or has problems  one has to visit the website  its a bit confusing  for backup had to install from their website  i have been buyers of western digital products for a long time  the seals/packing of wd external hard drives should be made more strong and reliable  even some packets i have received in semiopen  packing of products can be easily opened  see picture  quality and storage and spped are good the media could not be loaded  the product stopped working today idk whats happened can u replace it  the moment i tried to connect the hdd  the device started huge noise as if there the internal fan of a cooler was switched on  i didnt expect the noise/sound from a hdd  i had a wd hdd which was working fine and without noise  i was surprised that the new one had this issue  the second issue was accessing the hdd  initial few times i got a popup asking to format the drive and when i tried to format i got an error message that the format failed due to an error  i started to doubt if this was really a new piece or a refurbished piece  sellers do have a habit of cheating the customers by getting rid of defective pieces first  i believe that happened today as well  overall  the hdd is working fine now though it gave me some initial trouble  there is an occasional noise from the hdd and i dont know the reason for that  im not that happy because of this experience of buying electronic product online  this definitely makes me remember before i decide to order an electronic product again  আমি বিগত দুই বছরে নিজস্ব ব্যবহারের জন্য wd harddisk চারটে কিনেছি । খুব ভালো সার্ভিস । সব থকে বড় ব্যাপার হল আজ অবধি কোন ডেটা মিসিং হয়নি কিম্বা ক্রাক হয়নি । ধন্যবাদ । very good product  easy to handle light weight external hard disk and data transfer speed also very good  coping speed is ok i am using this product for daily cleaning of sofas  wall dusting this is my 1st time purchasing an external hdd  i chose wd reading all those reviews and hearing their prompt services  anyway so i transferred almost 40gb stuffs from my laptop to this hdd and the transfer speed was around 70mbps on average and took me nearly 6 minutes  i was expecting it to touch over 100mbps mark as it has usb 3 but anyway  the product is extremely light weight and small  great for portability na edit 13rd week of 2021the looks are just fine  usually these devices come as plug and play  but this time i couldnt figure out what the issue is  my pc recognizes this device as does my previous wd hdd  but i couldnt use the new one  as seen in the image  it shows as unallocated space in the disk partition  and i cant make it to work  this is highly unusual and lets see what amazon will do for thisedit 24th week of 2021amazon amazes me as usual  got a brand new one for my faulty drive  within the replacement window without much hassleand abt the new drive  it sure is a cool one  yet to check the speeds and other info  with 454 tb space from my 5tb drive  i will update as soon as it passes the test for bad sectors  and i would recommend doing that mandatorily for new drivespros1 good looking  taking very small space and light in weight2 good built quality3 doesnt make much noisecons1 very small led notification light2 slight heating up during checking phaseon the whole  just like the marvel and dc fued  dont get confused over segate and this  because years of my experience has made it clear that wd is reliable and stays with you for years to come  given you handle it properly  just check for the bad sectors when u get it new and just plug and play  will update after further usage  with usb 20 it gives a transfer rate of about 22 mbps  although it keeps on varying from 1 mbps to 22 mbps  with usb 30 port it gives a transfer rate of about 40 to 50 mbps  at one point of time ii also got a transfer rate of about 70 mbps  my laptop has usb 20 port so it gave about 20 mbps  at first i thought of returning it but when i used it in usb 30 port  it gave 40 mbps transfer rate  after searching on net  i found that every harddisk gives this much transfer rate although they mention speeds in gbps but thats all theoretical  so if you want to buy a harddisk you can go for this as its durabilty and serviceability is high as compared to other brands  also it is very small in size and hence portablealso  you will get a storage of 931 gb although it has a storage of 1 tb  this is great for backups and exchange data with friends and family members but only thing is i can not connect it with my samsung galaxy phone they should provide an additional software for connecting it to android devices super getting very slow transfer speed 1  transfer speed is 110 to 120 mb  dont expect hight rate transfer speed above one is maximum speed i noticed while transfering data from laptop to hard disk2  design is too good3  really slim and fit into pocket also4  compatiability is nice5  packaging is tight and crisp6  deliver time packaging was good from amazon7  data security also given in the hard disk8  i purchased in ₹4444 2tb hard diskyou can got for it if you want a pocket friendly and fit in to your budget  value for money good प्राइस sleem product very handy and light weight  been a month  nothing more to say  data storage please dont buy this it stopped working and the seller does not respond even in warranty periodupdate amazon helped me get in touch and i got a new replacement hard disk which works fine  it was delivered within 24 hours  the size of the hd and the speeds of data transfer are awesome  i was initially looking for 12 tb but the price of the hd attracted me to go for 5tbthe actual capacity is 45 tb  the media could not be loaded  the purpose of wd 4tb my passport is to be a backup drive of your data  it is well designed for the purpose  i have had many wd products in the past and they have been very reliable  i want to share some great features about this product1  storage capacity i have bought wd 4tb my passport portable external hard drive  blue  with automatic backup  256bit aes hardware encryption  software protection2  transfer speedthe wd my passport 4tb comes with a portable hard drive and a high speed usb 30 connector  the portable storage comes with a 3 year warrantyi had no problem transferring both large files taking several minutes and many many smaller files in large batches back and forth between pc and drive3  portability and durabilityits small size and light weight make it great for traveling and being able to grab and go and it wont take up much desk space  i highly recommend the my passportthere  s also an option to save backups to a cloud service such a dropbox so you don  t have to worry about bringing the drive with you everywhere4  securitythe drive comes with wd discovery for either windows and mac  you can set up the hardware encryption with this app  with the encryption software  you can set a password so that whenever you access the hard drive you have to enter the password  you can protect your private data  you can set up scheduled backups through the app  you can not schedule it through windows if you have hard drive encryption enabled5  compatibilitypreloaded on the drive is a pair of install wrappers for western digital  s discovery dashboard – one for windows and one for mac  running them should  ideally  download the latest version of the utility from the internet and install it on your machine  go to western digital  s support website and download it from there before it would actually work   this then lets you install 3 basic apps  one for backups  another for security management  and one for maintenance and health monitoring of the drive6  gamingusb 30 is quite important here as the speed can affect its waiting time and game responsiveness  this drive comes with usb 30 that matches the speed of ssd also it matches ps4 coloursonly con is there is no usb type coverall  if you need an affordable portable drive as storage expansion or for backing up your computer  you will find my passport 4tb is an easy and safe choice  been using it for a couple of months now  no issues so far  i also edit photos from it  speed is good enough for that  good  storage capacity is good but not working properly just check for the bad sectors after purchasing and i think the write speed is low not responding with laptops its damage pic and your agency tack back product and not replaced new one or not refund payment please solve problem amazon asked me what i liked or disliked while writing the reviewdislike  my first order for this product  seller appario  was a fake one  when i held the hard disk it felt lightweight  on connecting it to two laptops on different ports the light would switch on however the disk drive would never show  the hard disk didnt vibrate  rotating disks were not felt   the disk management of windows didnt detect it too  it simply showed up in task bar as my passport 6267 upon checking usb drivers it showed code 43  set address failed  seems a pretty famous error if you look it up on google  checked the s/n on wd site and it showed warranty till 2024 strange  tried to update drivers  but no success  finally put it in replacementlike  same seller this time sent original product  got 363 tb usable out of 4 tb  write speeds are 117 mb/s  copying from hdd to laptop or reverse  both same   hard disk is really portable and i liked the colour options  bought a case for it as well  separate positive review on that too   thank you  one of the best options available in the market  portable  lightweight  crossdevice compatible and value for moneytest with my realme gt master edition  android phone  over otg  working finetransfer speed is upto 80100mbps on 7200rpm hdd with amd ryzen 7 5600h  windows 11  the media could not be loaded  amazing product with good quality and looks awesome i am using this drive for past one year and it served me welli have been using it to carry my data as carrying my gaming laptop to my collage is quite hardthe drive is quite reliable when it comes to speed  the speed is goodit offer some great security for the price as it offers hardware based security at this price pointif you are looking for a slim  reliable and secure hdd then you cant go wrong with this oneits a open recommendation from me just go for it  the drives look very nice  and are half as thick as my old wd drives with the same capacity  transfer speed is about the same  but these drives are noisy  i have two of them  and i havent had such noise drives since the 90s when i could hear my disk drive  i just use them for backups so i dont care  but its a surprise that considering older wd drives dont make so much noise  these do  i doubt i received a defective one  because i have two drives  and both are noisy  this is just the way they are  yes its light weightedits too small in size u can carry in palm easly  nice product great deal at its price portable and the right size nice  less noisy  good speed colour is white and somewhat little storage due to internal aap installation  very comprehensive lightweight nice product its much better than i expectedslim and light weight  data transfer speed is good  boots fastdesign is also finecable is quite shortbut couldnt install wd software  tried 4 to 5 times  still it didnt  liked it the media could not be loaded  very compact product from trusted brand  quality product it is handy and has good storage capacity  copy speed is okay  will recommend this product to everyone  well  its good but you should go for one with type cit can easily give speed of 120mbps write speedsome will find problem like writing speed is 25mbps but there is a solution for that  some people may find problem with connectivity that its not showing in your pc or something like that but its not a huge problem at all you just do one thing go on youtube and search your problem will be solved  its compact and lightweight in this segmentim not talking about ssdssds are very light than hddbut in hdd segment its comparatively light it is better  lightweight  portable  nice design  storage is about 18t  transfer speed is quite good  quality is good  comes with password protection  backup and some more features  overall satisfied with the product  wd is best to choose among other brands its not like other brands are bad but considering every aspect of wd that includes service  product quality  longivity etc wd is best and wd failure rate is lower compare to seagate and other brands actually quality defers from region to region guys and for those who are complaining about disk not working etc etc plz dont try to plug and unplug the cable to hdd more no of times cuz the brands are made them worst by manufacturing the inside drive as a soldered to motherboard and its not good when u plug and unplug many times roughly then the solder will loose its grip and may break from motherboard so use it delicately and we request the ext hdd manufacturers to bring back the old sata type connection not this crappy soldered models  and the reading speed writing speed are as usual 120140mbps in usb 30  31 interface  thank u wd and amazons intime delivery and package is awesome  good product nice the media could not be loaded  read write speed are almost same 120 mbps  though some vedios shows 45 gbps transfer rate from hard disk to pc but i never got that speed even though i have a thunder bolt port and usb 32 gen 1 port  in both speed are the same good for average speed transfer it is not supporting ps4  good when i recieved it i was happy i had earlie purcahe red one which spins a lots even afater safely remove this one not seemsi tested it usign hdd regenration and then hdd tune pro again 5 time i tested for surface test usign hdd sentinel scanning took in usb 3 only 4 hours 20 mins and scannign in hdd regenratio 5 hours 20 min that insane in usb 3 i means else it ould hav kten 2 days in usb 20 and transfer speed i means i copied my old wd 4tb files to this i put in usb 2 that old wd 4tb and tranfer somver 800 gb and the speed was averatge 37mb/sec this hardisk was attachd in usb 3 normally the speed might reach 200 mb /sec if connected both in usb 3 or even more as scannign speed during surface test and otehr test shows that speed 240 mb/sechpe it lasts more than5 yeas as i had one wd drive interal still over 1750 days runtime stil no errors another wd i purcahsed in sep 2014 1 tb wd passport ultra from amazon used occasional still no badsector wd are reliable just need to be carefully if so many chuk files like photos and all corrupts the mft table as large amount of files they are i mean photos and all small files if large fiels i had less no of file count  the mft get corrupteduse paragon hardisk manager to compact mft and it works againstill never believe a hardisk it can fail any time alwasys keep backup copy 321 rule keep mft record of that hardisk using wiztree software  mft dump  you can use to analyse if hardisk get corrputed or data recovery time  good storage capacity it has enough space for my movies and game storage  it has great speed and the design is simple and super  i really loved the product  nothing its so small just fight to pocket data transfer is speed as compared to my old sony  till now its performance is nice  perfect for daily use and travelling perpose best external hdd with enough capacity to store  more importantly  oraganized files rather than junk  else  youll keep crying for more storage even after having 4tb of storage space  went for this passport hd storage due to wds reputation  even though my experience with an earlier wd elements drive was not that greatissues with passport drive1 wd discovery did not install initially  i tried on 2 separate computers running win 10 it would install till 18  and then not proceed  this is a known issue if you search on the net  surprising that wd hasnt fixed it yet2  following the workarounds managed to install wd discovery  next the wd backup app didnt install  this too had to be worked around before was finally able to install it3  transferring files took ages  got error messages for several files  documents  images etc   which didnt get copied4  the transferred files and folders on the drive did not display when i attached the drive to my other computer  that was the main reason i got the drive  to be able to have the files in one place to use on several computers  conclusion  installing  running and transferring files was very time consuming and frustrating  its better to install other software for backup/transferring files  much faster and more reliableam unlikely to go with any wd products again  the media could not be loaded  good drive got corrupted even though i was careful with the usage  fortunately  i got it replaced  i love this hard disk its quite compact and easy to use  i have kept my data on this disk have not got any issues regarding data corruption or any other issues so far  it also have a feature to encrypt the disk with password which tightens the data security  writing review for a replacement drive after the first one failed very shortly within a day of using it  suddenly after a while the drive started to make loud fanlike noise with lots of clicking sounds  the drive head trying to copy/fetch data  and finally after sometime i heard the click of death  google it if you want to know more  and the drive stopped getting recognized by windows and the os stopped responding whenever this drive was plugged in  i googled and got to know that it happens when there are bad sectors detected or mechanical failure inside  luckily after sometime i was able to copy back the data from the drive to my local existing internal hdd drive and immediately asked for replacement  thanks a lot to amazon for getting it quickly replaced by a new drivei used a software recommend by western digital to check the health of the drive  data lifeguard diagnostic for windows  great software to check for problems with any hddworks fine when there are no mechanical problems inside and is light weight and portable too  have to be a little more careful while handling it because of its size  contains much more space that i could save my whole laptop data at once    must have… i got a storage capacity of 18gb that  s a bit low on the product and the security software is not concluded have to download it separately again overall the product is fine slim and elegant was in a dilemma whether to buy wd or seagate  they are both equally reputable in this space  post analysis settled for this version of the my passport has it seemed like it was good in terms of value for money  in terms of the seller  no issueshowever  wd passport  and im assuming all the other external hard disks  have some serious compatible issues with mac  in my case  i was on a high serrier version os and my passport was not being detected by mac  after alot of research across wd website  forums  blogs etc  i figured out that its a very common issue with alot of folks worldwide  in the end  i had to upgrade to the latest os  big sur   download wd utilities and post some messing around  it magically got detectedonce  its detected there are no issues and works great  no words than the bestest drive in the market  i have already used all other brandsbut its the best ever overall it was good  no problem in product  perfectly fine but the cover in which it was sent was broken  i did not complain as product was ok the wd is best for making storage hard drivespros1 i got product on time and started using it from same day  till now no issues2100mbps+ read speed with usb 30 only3  write speed is little slow  max 30mbps  cons1 the only drawback is  it give you 4500gb space instead of 5120gb and as you know 10  of drive need to be empty to get better performance  that means 450gb is useless and you actually get 4tb for proper usage while you paid for 5tb space2  the wd have a contest to fool you  at least by this seller   the same hdd is on amazon without that scratch coupon  it have free hdd portable cover worth of rs10003  also that wd software which comes inside hdd is useless  as in regular usage you dont need such softwares  i agree in initial days of usage you might face some hdd detection issues  but that are just usb driver specific only   you need to update usb drivers if needed  conclusion  dont get fool for laptop and go with hdd which have free cover and also try to research on which hdd give you more space  ie wd4tb2tb1tb or any other brand with good storage  and go with it no matter which brand  very thin  portable  good looking drive i have been using various hard disks since many years  this one is by far the smallest  fastest and highest capacity drive of my lot  fully recommended  1dec2020  i received wd 5 tb black my passport hddon 13dec2020  i made backup of my previous hdd content  on 16dec2020  when i plugged in my new wd 5 tb black my passport hdd i found all my data to be unreading/unaccessable/ basically a unformated drive pop up appeared  that means all my data  you know what i meantthe amazon return window was closed and all my backup data was lostdid some troubleshooting and discovered  hdd retains information till the time its connected to laptop  once hdd is ejected  using wd discovery software     reconnected back  boom  all data gonei called up wd  told them everything  performed troubleshooting steps on call and rma number was generatedi went to the wd center  gave them my faulty hdd and  on 2jan2021  received a new wd 5 tb my passporttip  please use wd drive utilities and format your hdd  twice  even if the data is unaccessable  the reason being there is bits  bytes of data on hdd  so formating your hdd will give some peace of mind  remember format  dont do quick format   wd service was appreciated a lot  even though red color hdd was bit querky   by the way  please check wd official website for accurate toll free number  good one i am very happy product is handy  fast  easy to connect nice but its very costly nice product and worth to money nice one light weight wd security software is not working  els good  nice product  using for storing educational videos for my son  very good customer support from wd  hope it performs well and lasts long☺ useful for storing documents and light weight to carry it around  the media could not be loaded  making a very weird sound periodically  quite like a leaking tap  the disc itself came wellpacked and seal was intact but the sound is an issue  bought 5 hard drives before this from local electronics store  none had such issues  wd itself is a very good brand in terms of reliability and performance  i have 2 more from the same brand  but the first time i am having this issue  when the amazon delivery guy handed me this item he fished it out from the bottom of the rucksack  he dropped the rucksack to the floor from above 25 feet before fishing the hdd out   these items are malhandled by these delivery guys without any sensitivity to the nature of the content  that is why broken coffee mugs  books with the spine and corners broken et cetera are the most returned items on amazon  good seller  handling of delivery of sensitive equipments by amazon delivery guy is below par although  should not blame the seller for that  none of the electronic goods i bought from appario retail ever gave me trouble but the hdd i have bought this time is making a weird sound every 3 seconds like a hiccup  the delivery people dont have any sensitivity when it comes to handling delicate items  except for mobile phones maybe   for other electronics items they adopt a gotohellforallicare attitude  1these items should not be placed at the bottom of the heap  they did in this case  2these items should not be subjected to dropping from a height  while getting it out of the heavy rucksack packed to the brim the delivery guy dropped the rucksack from waist level to the floor  about 25 feet drop  add to that the weight of other irems on top of it and do the math  i have already asked for a replacement for this item  waiting to see how that works26th november  update  the replacement is working fine  lightweight  portable drive  good for media and doc storage  good data transfer speeds good'"
